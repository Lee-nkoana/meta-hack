Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily. Two percent (2%) of subjects receiving ZIAGEN 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving ZIAGEN 300 mg twice daily had this event.\n\nbCNA30024 was a multi-center, double-blind, controlled trial in which 649 HIV-1-infected, therapy-naive adults were randomized and received either ZIAGEN (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily); or zidovudine (300 mg twice daily), EPIVIR (150 mg twice daily), and efavirenz (600 mg once daily). CNA30024 used double-blind ascertainment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions. During the blinded portion of the trial, suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9% of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3% of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group.\n\nLaboratory Abnormalities:Laboratory abnormalities observed in clinical trials of ZIAGEN were anemia, neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and elevations of CPK, blood glucose, and triglycerides.

Primary safety assessment in the ARROW (COL105677) trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator. No additional safety issues were identified in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir and lamivudine once-daily compared with historical data in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use.

However, subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily. Five percent (5%) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2% of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily.

Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric subjects receiving abacavir (CNA3006) as compared with adult subjects (CNA30024).\n\nOther Adverse Events\n\nIn addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT.\n\nPediatric Subjects Once-Daily Versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677)\n\nThe safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of abacavir was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of abacavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposures.\n\nBody as a Whole: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat.\n\nCardiovascular: Myocardial infarction.\n\nHepatic: Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .\n\nSkin: Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN, respectively. Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN, and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases.\n\nThere have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] ."}

Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. A third randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (LATITUDE) enrolled patients who had metastatic high-risk CSPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg once daily. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2230 patients in the 5 randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1-4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1-4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms.\nIn the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for abiraterone acetate-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) that occurred more commonly (>2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>20%) that occurred more commonly (\u22652%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3-4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (\u22651%) resulting in discontinuation of abiraterone acetate and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders.\nDeaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the abiraterone acetate arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in \u22655 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration.\n\nCOU-AA-301: Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy\nCOU-AA-301 enrolled 1195 patients with metastatic CRPC who had received prior docetaxel chemotherapy. Patients were not eligible if AST and/or ALT \u22652.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases.

Grade 3-4 cardiac failure occurred in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. There were no treatment discontinuations and two deaths due to cardiac failure in the placebo group.\nIn the same combined data, the majority of arrhythmias were grade 1 or 2. There was one death associated with arrhythmia and three patients with sudden death in the abiraterone acetate arms and five deaths in the placebo arms. There were 7 (0.3%) deaths due to cardiorespiratory arrest in the abiraterone acetate arms and 2 (0.1%) deaths in the placebo arms. Myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction led to death in 3 patients in the placebo arms and 3 deaths in the abiraterone acetate arms.\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of abiraterone acetate with prednisone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\n\nRespiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: non-infectious pneumonitis.\n\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.\n\nHepatobiliary Disorders: fulminant hepatitis, including acute hepatic failure and death.\n\nCardiac Disorders: QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes (observed in patients who developed hypokalemia or had underlying cardiovascular conditions).\n\nImmune System Disorders \u2013 Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic reactions (severe allergic reactions that include, but are not limited to difficulty swallowing or breathing, swollen face, lips, tongue or throat, or an itchy rash (urticaria))."}
{"prompt": "What interactions does Abiraterone Acetate have?", "completion": "7.1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes\n\nBased on in vitro data, abiraterone acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4.\n\nIn a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate dosing frequency [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\nIn a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\n\n\n7.2 Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes\n\nAbiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\nIn a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with abiraterone acetate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]."}

It is administered as a single intramuscular (IM) injection.\nRSV season is usually\u00a0late fall (November) through spring (April), with a peak in January and February.\nAbrysvo may be given at any time of the year, but where possible, should be offered before the start of the RSV season.\nOnly one dose of Abrysvo is needed. It is not given every RSV season.\nAbrysvo works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against RSV's prefusion F protein, preventing respiratory disease. When given to pregnant women, these antibodies cross the placenta, providing passive immunity that protects newborns under 6 months from severe RSV infections. Abrysvo belongs to the drug class called RSV vaccines.\nAbrysvo is the only RSV vaccine approved for use during pregnancy.\nAbrysvo first gained FDA approval on May 31, 2023, for adults aged 60 and older. This approval was extended twice to include pregnant women and adults aged 18 through 59. Approvals were based on positive results from three clinical trials:\nRENOIR (Phase 3 RCT, NCT05035212, n=34,284 adults \u226560 years): Abrysvo showed 66.7% efficacy against RSV lower respiratory tract illness with two+ symptoms and 85.7% efficacy with three+ symptoms.

This is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. Seek urgent medical attention for symptoms such as weakness or tingling in your legs that may spread to your upper body and arms, muscle weakness, or difficulty breathing, swallowing or speaking.\nPotential risk of preterm birth. Abrysvo may increase the risk of having your baby too early (preterm). To lessen this potential risk, Abrysvo should not be administered to pregnant women before 32 weeks of gestation. It should only be administered from 32 weeks through 36 weeks gestational age.\u00a0\nAllergic reactions. Vaccinations may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in some people. These usually happen within the first few minutes after an injection. Abrysvo vaccine should be administered in a facility that can provide the appropriate medical treatment and supervision to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever reacted to a vaccine. See urgent medical attention if you develop facial or throat swelling, a dry cough, a rash, or difficulty breathing.\nFainting may occur following the administration of vaccines, such as Abrysvo vaccine. Sit or lie down during the vaccination to avoid injury from fainting.\nPeople who are immunocompromised, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to vaccines.\nVaccination with Abrysvo may not protect everybody who receives it.\nAbrysvo is not approved for use in children.\nThese are not all the side effects of Abrysvo.

Reductions in energy intake amounting to 100 to 200 kcal were reported with gum arabic doses ranging from 5 to 40 g.Calame 2011 A clinical trial of healthy females (N=120) reported decreased BMI and body fat following consumption of gum arabic (A. senegal) 30 g daily for 6 weeks.Babiker 2012\n\nPeriodontal disease\n\nAnimal and in vitro data\nWhole gum mixtures of acacia inhibit the growth of periodontic bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, when added to culture medium at concentrations of 0.5% to 1%.Clark 1993 The erosive effects of citric acid on enamel were muted in vitro when mixed with gum arabic.Beyer 2010\n\nClinical data\nAt a concentration of 0.5%, acacia whole gum mixture inhibited bacterial protease enzymes, suggesting acacia may be useful in limiting the development of periodontal disease. In addition, chewing an acacia-based gum for 7 days reduced mean gingival and plaque scores compared with use of a sugar-free gum. Total differences in these scores were significant between groups (P<0.05), suggesting that acacia gum primarily inhibits the early deposition of plaque.Gazi 1991, Lindquist 2011 In a small clinical study (N=11), a gum arabic lozenge increased oral pH after a rinse with simulated gastric acid, protecting against enamel erosion.Gazi 1991, Lindquist 2011\n\nRenal effects\n\nAnimal data\nA series of reports were published on the use of acacia gum in rats with induced renal failure. Effects included antihypertensive reactions, reduced anemia and proteinuria, and improved oxidative stress.Ali 2011, Ali 2013, Ali 2014, Ali 2014 Enhanced creatinine clearance was demonstrated in healthy mice given gum arabic 10% in drinking water.Nasir 2013 An antioxidant effect may contribute toward observed efficacy.Gado 2013\n\nClinical data\nIncreased excretion of nitrogen and urea was observed in patients with chronic renal failure given gum acacia.Khan 2010 However, in a 12-week single-arm clinical study conducted among patients with sickle cell disease (N=47), reductions in serum urea levels were not sustained after the first month of gum arabica 30 g daily administration.Kaddam 2019, Kaddam 2019"}

It is used along with psychosocial support and helps to prevent the cravings and urge to drink alcohol that people with alcohol use disorder experience.\nDrinking alcohol alters the balance of the chemical messengers or neurotransmitters in your brain. Acamprosate is thought to work by helping to restore the balance of these neurotransmitters. It's thought that it primarily works by decreasing the excessive excitation that accompanies alcohol dependence.\nAcamprosate is similar in structure - an analog of - two neurotransmitters called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and taurine. And while it's not clear exactly how it works, it's been suggested that acamprosate works by targeting GABA and NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamatergic receptor activity. It's also been suggested that it works by supplying calcium.\nIn 2004, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a branded version of acamprosate calcium called Campral. Campral has since been discontinued, but generic versions of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are available."}

{"prompt": "What are the side effects of Accelerated Covid-19 Test Kit?", "completion": "Localized Reactions: During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema or edema or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream.\n\nTwo recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream.\n\nIn patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%.\n\nIn clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%).\nAllergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.\nSystemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/ for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions."}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Accucaine?", "completion": "Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection, USP is indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks, when the accepted procedures for these techniques as described in standard textbooks are observed."}
{"prompt": "What are the side effects of Accucaine?", "completion": "Systemic\n\nAdverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine HCl are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose- related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:\nCentral Nervous System\n\nCNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.\n\nDrowsiness following the administration of lidocaine HCl is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.\nCardiovascular System\n\nCardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.\nAllergic\n\nAllergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in the multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur as result of sensitivity to lidocaine, but are infrequent. If allergic reactions do occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.\n\nThere have been no reports of cross sensitivity between lidocaine hydrochloride and procainamide or between lidocaine hydrochloride and quinidine.\nNeurologic\n\nThe incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine HCl for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches, hypotension and backache; 2 percent for shivering; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, nausea, respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic.\n\nIn the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally. These may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures.\n\nThere have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration.\nHematologic\n\nMethemoglobinemia."}

Used principally in situations involving acute IOP elevation or chronically elevated IOP that is refractory to maximal topical ocular hypotensive therapy prior to a more definitive procedure to reduce IOP. Long-term use limited by systemic adverse effects.\nAdjunctive treatment of secondary glaucoma.\nShort-term use in acute angle-closure glaucoma to lower IOP before appropriate laser or incisional surgery. Should not be used for long-term treatment of angle-closure glaucoma. (See Contraindications under Cautions.)\nAcute Mountain Sickness\nPrevention or amelioration of symptoms (e.g., headache, lassitude, insomnia, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness) associated with acute mountain sickness.\nShortens the time of acclimatization. If acute mountain sickness develops, shortens duration; does not obviate need to stop ascent or to descend.\nAlso used in the treatment and prevention of high-altitude sleep disorders. Decreases periodic breathing and apnea and improves oxygenation.\nSeizure Disorders\nManagement (in combination with other anticonvulsants) of centrencephalic epilepsies (e.g., petit mal, unlocalized seizures); may be ineffective for prolonged therapy. Has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies in specific seizure types.\nEdema\nAdjunctive treatment of edema due to CHF or drug therapy. Less potent diuretic than thiazide diuretics; metabolic acidosis resulting in loss of diuretic effect occurs after 2\u20134 days of continuous therapy.\nPeriodic Paralysis\nHas been used in the treatment of hyperkalemic and hypokalemic forms of periodic paralysis\u2020 [off-label]."}

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nCardiovascular: Acute myocardial infarction, thromboembolism (see WARNINGS), stroke.\nImmune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity, including angioedema and urticaria (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).\nNervous System: Myopathy with peripheral neuropathy has been reported during therapy with acitretin. Both conditions improved with discontinuation of the drug.\nPsychiatric: Aggressive feelings and/or suicidal thoughts have been reported. These events, including self-injurious behavior, have been reported in patients taking other systemically administered retinoids, as well as in patients taking acitretin. Since other factors may have contributed to these events, it is not known if they are related to acitretin (see PRECAUTIONS).\nReproductive: Vulvo-vaginitis due to Candida albicans.\nSkin and Appendages: Thinning of the skin, skin fragility, and scaling may occur all over the body, particularly on the palms and soles; nail fragility is frequently observed. Madarosis and exfoliative dermatitis/erythroderma have been reported (see WARNINGS).\nVascular Disorders: Capillary leak syndrome (see WARNINGS).\nClinical Trials\nDuring clinical trials with acitretin, 513 of 525 (98%) subjects reported a total of 3,545 adverse events. One-hundred sixteen subjects (22%) left trials prematurely, primarily because of adverse experiences involving the mucous membranes and skin. Three subjects died. Two of the deaths were not drug-related (pancreatic adenocarcinoma and lung cancer); the other subject died of an acute myocardial infarction, considered remotely related to drug therapy.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Ackee?", "completion": "Analgesic effects\n\nAnimal data\nIn mice orally administered an aqueous leaf extract of B. sapida, analgesic effects were observed for 2 of 3 pain tests conducted. Writhing was significantly reduced at B. sapida extract doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg compared to controls; percentage inhibition at these extract doses was 52% and 67%, respectively, whereas aspirin produced a 78% inhibition. Paw licking was also significantly reduced with each B. sapida extract dose compared to controls; respective inhibitions were 65% and 54%, whereas morphine produced 100% inhibition.(Olayinka 2021)\n\nAntioxidant effects\n\nAnimal data\nAntioxidant activity of ackee has been documented via free radical scavenging properties as well as increased activity of antioxidant enzyme systems (ie, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxide) and reduced malonaldehyde.(Barnaby 2018, Ojo 2017)\n\nAntiparasitic activity\n\nAnimal data\nThree doses of a B. sapida stem bark ethanolic extract were safe, nontoxic, and prophylactically effective against chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium berghei in mice when compared with untreated controls (P<0.001). The lowest dose (200 mg/kg) exhibited comparable effects to the positive control artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem). The extract had little to no effect as a curative or suppressive agent at 200, 400, or 800 mg/kg.(Otegbade 2017)\n\nDiabetes\n\nAnimal data\nIn a diabetic rat model, an ethanolic extract of B. sapida stem bark administered orally significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) at all 3 doses tested (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day) compared to untreated diabetic controls (P<0.05). After 21 days, mean FBG was similar between the 150 mg/kg/day extract group and the positive control glibenclamide (88.2 and 88.4 mg/dL, respectively); neither value was significantly different than nondiabetic controls (87.2 mg/dL). Serum insulin, insulin resistance, and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction also improved significantly with B. sapida extract at all 3 doses versus the diabetic control (P<0.05). Values for all 3 parameters at the 150 mg/kg/day extract dose were not significantly different from the nondiabetic control and were more pronounced than in the glibenclamide-treated diabetic group. The extract significantly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes.(Ojo 2017)\nThe significant FBG results documented previously with 3 doses of B. sapida stem bark extract in the diabetic rat model were repeated in another study, which also evaluated effects of the extract on lipid parameters. As with FBG, values of all 8 lipid parameters (ie, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very low\u2013density lipoprotein, non\u2013high-density lipoprotein [HDL], HDL, triglycerides, atherogenic index, and coronary artery index) for the 150 mg/kg/day extract dose were not significantly different from the nondiabetic control and were significantly better than in the glibenclamide-treated diabetic group (P<0.05).(Ojo 2020)"}

Processing may reduce alkaloid content and/or alter alkaloid composition, thus reducing potency(Liu 2017); however, poisoning may still occur after consumption of processed aconite root.(Brown 2018, Lin 2004)\nThe following pharmacological effects of Aconitum alkaloids have been described: analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antirheumatic activities(Feng 2003, Hikino 1980); positive inotropic effects(Honerj\u00e4ger 1983); and regulation of neurological disorders.(Feng 2003, Herzog 1964) However, only limited studies are available, most of which were performed in China and Japan.\n\nAntiarrhythmic effects\n\nClinical data\nGuanfu base A, an alkaloid isolated from the root of the related Aconitum coreanum Rapaics, has demonstrated efficacy as an antiarrhythmic agent in preclinical and clinical studies and has undergone phase 3 clinical trials in China.(Sun 2015) It should be noted that according to a 2016 scientific statement by the American Heart Association regarding drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure, aconite is recognized as a product that has possibly harmful cardiovascular effects, such as decreased heart rate and ventricular tachycardia, and that may be harmful for patients with heart failure.(Page 2016)\n\nAnti-inflammatory/Analgesic properties\n\nAnimal data\nIn animal models, aconitine and related compounds have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.(Feng 2003, He 2018, Hikino 1980, Murayama 1991) Studies using mechanical and thermal stimuli to cause pain in mice have shown that, at subanalgesic doses, processed Aconitum root administered orally inhibited the development of morphine tolerance both partially and dose dependently in morphine-naive mice and reversed already developed morphine tolerance in morphine-tolerant mice compared with placebo.(Shu 2006a, Shu 2006b, Shu 2007, Shu 2008)\n\nClinical data\nResults of a study using Japanese kampo preparations suggest that Aconiti tuber may increase nitric oxide production in humans, a possible mechanism for Aconiti tuber's purported effect on improving a peripheral feeling of coldness. Eleven and 13 patients, respectively, received kampo formulas including and excluding Aconiti tuber. Nitrite and nitrate levels were increased at 4 weeks in those taking Aconiti tuber formulas.(Yamada 2005)"}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of ACT COVID-19 Antibody Test?", "completion": "Lidocaine and prilocaine cream (a eutectic mixture of lidocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5%) is indicated as a topical anesthetic for use on:\n- normal intact skin for local analgesia.\n- genital mucous membranes for superficial minor surgery and as pretreatment for infiltration anesthesia.\nLidocaine and prilocaine cream is not recommended in any clinical situation when penetration or migration beyond the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is possible because of the ototoxic effects observed in animal studies (see WARNINGS)."}
{"prompt": "What are the side effects of ACT COVID-19 Antibody Test?", "completion": "Localized Reactions: During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, the skin at the site of treatment may develop erythema or edema or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. Rare cases of discrete purpuric or petechial reactions at the application site have been reported. Rare cases of hyperpigmentation following the use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream have been reported. The relationship to lidocaine and prilocaine cream or the underlying procedure has not been established. In clinical studies on intact skin involving over 1,300 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated subjects, one or more such local reactions were noted in 56% of patients, and were generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within 1 or 2 hours. There were no serious reactions that were ascribed to lidocaine and prilocaine cream.\n\nTwo recent reports describe blistering on the foreskin in neonates about to undergo circumcision. Both neonates received 1.0 g of lidocaine and prilocaine cream.\n\nIn patients treated with lidocaine and prilocaine cream on intact skin, local effects observed in the trials included: paleness (pallor or blanching) 37%, redness (erythema) 30%, alterations in temperature sensations 7%, edema 6%, itching 2% and rash, less than 1%.\n\nIn clinical studies on genital mucous membranes involving 378 lidocaine and prilocaine cream-treated patients, one or more application site reactions, usually mild and transient, were noted in 41% of patients. The most common application site reactions were redness (21%), burning sensation (17%) and edema (10%).\nAllergic Reactions: Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine or prilocaine can occur. They are characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock. If they occur they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.\nSystemic (Dose Related) Reactions: Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine and prilocaine cream are unlikely due to the small dose absorbed (see Pharmacokinetics subsection of CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine and/or prilocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents including CNS excitation and/or depression (light-headedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/ for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions."}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Actemra?", "completion": "Actemra (tocilizumab) is a FDA approved biological medicine that is given by intravenous infusion or injection under the skin to treat specific patients with COVID-19, rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, scleroderma, polyarticular or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and severe cytokine release syndrome.\nActemra was FDA approved to treat COVID-19 on December 21, 2022, for specific adult patients. Pediatric patients (aged 2 years to 18 years) with COVID-19 still have access to Actemra under emergency use authorization (EUA).\nActemra is a monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein in your body called interleukin-6 (IL-6).\u00a0 If this protein is activated, it causes your immune system to be overactive which results in inflammation and the signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease.\u00a0As Actemra blocks the interleukin-6 receptor, this is how it is thought to reduce the immune system from being overactive, so there is less inflammation and a reduction in the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases.\nAt a more technical level the mode of action (MOA) of Actemra is that it binds to IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) which have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is made by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts.\nActemra can be used with other medications as part your complete treatment."}

{"prompt": "What are the side effects of Acticlate?", "completion": "The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials or post-approval use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nGastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].\nSkin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme have been reported. Photosensitivity has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\nRenal: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].\nHypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).\nBlood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported.\nIntracranial Hypertension: Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].\nThyroid Gland Changes: When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Actidose?", "completion": "Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua should be used in a supervised medical facility or under the direction of a physician or poison control center.\nActidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua are indicated in the management of many types of poisoning emergencies when a toxin has been ingested or when indicated for a limited number of systemic poisonings resulting from parenteral overdosage or when the toxin has been totally absorbed. If physiologic conditions are optimal, activated charcoal most effectively adsorbs toxins with a molecular weight of 100 - 1,000 Daltons (AMU\u2019s).1 Activated charcoal may not be as effective in adsorbing low molecular weight substances such as aliphatic alcohols (methanol, isopropanol, ethanol, etc.) metals (iron, lead, mercury, etc.) and elements such as lithium.2. Two animal studies have demonstrated that very toxic and low molecular weight cyanide compounds are adsorbed by activated charcoal.21,22 The use of activated charcoal in toxic emergencies involving these substances is not contraindicated. Many poisonings involve multiple substances, therefore, Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua may be effective in adsorbing some or all of the ingested toxins.\nAdsorption of a toxin by activated charcoal can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. However, to use Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol or Actidose\u00ae-Aqua most effectively it is important to administer it as soon as possible to the victim of an ingested exposure. The longer the delay between the ingestion of the toxin and administration of activated charcoal, the less effective it will be. If syrup of ipecac is being used to produce emesis, administration of Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol or Actidose\u00ae-Aqua is customarily delayed until 30 \u2013 60 minutes after conclusion of emesis. In a study which used syrup of ipecac, 60 ml, activated charcoal did not interfere with the emetic effect of syrup of ipecac.23\nIf gastric lavage is being used to facilitate stomach evacuation a single dose of activated charcoal can be administered in the early stages of gastric lavage. If this technique is utilized, Actidose\u00ae-Aqua, which does not contain sorbitol, should be used. Upon completion of gastric lavage Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol can be instilled via the lavage tube. The only disadvantage to the use of activated charcoal in this fashion is that the gastric lavage returns will be black, thus making it difficult to evaluate what the patient ingested by visual examination. The primary advantage of this therapy is that activated charcoal can be administered early to the patient. The convenient packaging of Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua (except the 15gm/72ml size) in a squeeze bottle with a tapered nozzle expedites emergency treatment, allowing attachment to a gastric lavage tube and administration of contents.\nThe most common application of activated charcoal is in acute toxic exposures where Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua can adsorb toxins thereby preventing their absorption. Activated charcoal can also be used in some toxic emergencies when absorption is complete or exposure was via a parenteral route. This application usually involves repetitive or multiple doses of activated charcoal.\nMultiple doses of activated charcoal may be useful in adsorbing toxins which undergo enterohepatic circulation.13 Drugs which are subject to biliary secretion such as digitoxin are constantly secreted into the gastrointestinal tract and are reabsorbed resulting in prolonged toxicity. Frequent doses of activated charcoal can adsorb those toxins thereby preventing their reabsorption and enhancing toxin elimination through the gastrointestinal tract.\nMultiple dose activated charcoal is also used in what is termed gastrointestinal dialysis.14 There are only a limited number of toxins which may be eliminated by this method. Clinical judgement and the toxin\u2019s pharmacokinetic parameters must be considered to determine the applicability of this treatment which is not universally applicable.24 The toxin passively diffuses along a concentration gradient between blood which is perfusing the gastrointestinal tract and the luminal fluids. The multiple doses of activated charcoal adsorb the toxin thereby preventing its reabsorption further maximizing the concentration gradient which permits diffusion of even more toxin into the gastric lumen. Compounds most effectively transferred by this mechanism are lipophilic, uncharged and not excessively bound to proteins. Phenobarbital and theophylline are examples of toxins which can be eliminated more rapidly by this method.15,16\nActidose\u00ae with Sorbitol should not be used in each dose of the multiple dose activated charcoal regimen unless it is necessary to produce catharsis. Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol contains sorbitol which may produce excessive catharsis and resultant fluid and electrolyte problems if used at each dosing interval (see Precautions).9,25 Actidose\u00ae-Aqua should be used at dosage intervals when Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol is not being used. CATHARTICS SHOULD BE USED CAUTIOUSLY AND ONLY INTERMITTENTLY DURING MULTIPLE DOSE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL THERAPY.\nIf catharsis of activated charcoal does not occur following the use of Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol within 4 - 8 hours, an additional sorbitol dose of 1.5 gm/kg may be administered. Or, if desired, a saline cathartic such as magnesium citrate may be used if the patient\u2019s renal function is not impaired. Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua are formulated in palatable vehicles which eliminate the need to add additional taste or consistency enhancers. The use of supplementary chemicals, syrups, or dairy products should be avoided since their addition may compromise the adsorptive capacity of Actidose\u00ae with Sorbitol and Actidose\u00ae-Aqua."}

These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage, rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported:\n\nCentral Nervous System\n\nCNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest.\n\nDrowsiness following the administration of lidocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption.\n\nCardiovascular System\n\nCardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac arrest.\n\nAllergic\n\nAllergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to local anesthetic agents or to the methylparaben used as a preservative in multiple dose vials. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value.\n\nNeurologic\n\nThe incidences of adverse reactions associated with the use of local anesthetics may be related to the total dose of local anesthetic administered and are also dependent upon the particular drug used, the route of administration and the physical status of the patient. In a prospective review of 10,440 patients who received lidocaine for spinal anesthesia, the incidences of adverse reactions were reported to be about 3 percent each for positional headaches, hypotension and backache; 2 percent for shivering; and less than 1 percent each for peripheral nerve symptoms, nausea, respiratory inadequacy and double vision. Many of these observations may be related to local anesthetic techniques, with or without a contribution from the local anesthetic.\n\nIn the practice of caudal or lumbar epidural block, occasional unintentional penetration of the subarachnoid space by the catheter may occur. Subsequent adverse effects may depend partially on the amount of drug administered subdurally.\n\nThese may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances when caudal or lumbar epidural block has been attempted. Backache and headache have also been noted following use of these anesthetic procedures.\n\nThere have been reported cases of permanent injury to extraocular muscles requiring surgical repair following retrobulbar administration."}

Local application site reactions were reported by 5% of patients receiving Acyclovir Cream and 4% of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions at the site of topical application were dry lips, desquamation, dryness of skin, cracked lips, burning skin, pruritus, flakiness of skin, and stinging on skin; each adverse reaction occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving Acyclovir Cream and placebo. Three patients on Acyclovir Cream and one patient on placebo discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.\n\nAn additional study, enrolling 22 healthy adults, was conducted to evaluate the dermal tolerance of Acyclovir Cream compared with vehicle using single occluded and semi-occluded patch testing methodology. Both Acyclovir Cream and placebo showed a high and cumulative irritation potential. Another study, enrolling 251 healthy adults, was conducted to evaluate the contact sensitization potential of Acyclovir Cream using repeat insult patch testing methodology. Of 202 evaluable subjects, possible cutaneous sensitization reactions were observed in the same 4 (2%) subjects with both Acyclovir Cream and placebo, and these reactions to both Acyclovir Cream and placebo were confirmed in 3 subjects upon rechallenge.

This vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.\nTetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis are serious diseases caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. Tetanus enters the body through a cut or wound.\nTetanus (lockjaw) causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw so the victim cannot open the mouth or swallow. Tetanus leads to death in about 1 out of 10 cases.\nDiphtheria causes a thick coating in the nose, throat, and airways. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, or death.\nPertussis (whooping cough) causes coughing so severe that it can interfere with eating, drinking, or breathing.

{"prompt": "What are the side effects of Adalimumab Injection?", "completion": "The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\nSerious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nMalignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nHepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nNeurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nHematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nHeart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]\nAutoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nThe most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.\n\nThe proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).\n\nInfections\n\nIn the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\nTuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections\n\nIn 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\nAutoantibodies\n\nIn the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.\n\nLiver Enzyme Elevations\n\nThere have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years.\n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u22653 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects.\n\nOther Adverse Reactions\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies\n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. Most subjects received 40 mg adalimumab every other week [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\n\nTable 1 summarizes reactions reported at a rate of at least 5% in subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week compared to placebo and with an incidence higher than placebo. In Study RA-III, the types and frequencies of adverse reactions in the second year open-label extension were similar to those observed in the one-year double-blind portion.\n\nTable 1.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment.\n\nIn the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial.\n\nApproximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.\n\nPsoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)]. The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV.\n\nCrohn's Disease Clinical Studies\n\nAdults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn's disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n\nPediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn's disease.\n\nDuring the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively).\n\nA total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.\n\nA total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis.\n\nIn Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions.\n\nUlcerative Colitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n\nPlaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8)]. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%).\n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.\n\nFlare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.\n\nUveitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10, 14.11)]. The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n6.2 Immunogenicity\n\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products.\n\nThere are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Anti-Adalimumab Antibody Development Determined by ELISA and ECL Assay in Patients Treated with Adalimumab\nIndications\tStudy Duration\tAnti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ELISA (n/N)\tAnti-Adalimumab Antibody Incidence by ECL Assay (n/N)\nIn all patients who received adalimumab\tIn patients with serum adalimumab concentrations\n<2 mcg/mL\t\nn: number of patients with anti-adalimumab antibody; NR: not reported; NA: Not applicable (not performed)\na In patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX), the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 1% compared to 12% with adalimumab monotherapy\nb In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody was 6% compared to 26% with adalimumab monotherapy\nc This patient received concomitant MTX\nd In patients receiving concomitant MTX, the incidence of antibody development was 7% compared to 1% in RA\ne Subjects enrolled after completing 2 previous studies of 24 weeks or 12 weeks of treatments\nf In plaque psoriasis patients who were on adalimumab monotherapy and subsequently withdrawn from the treatment, the rate of antibodies to adalimumab after retreatment was similar to the rate observed prior to withdrawal\ng One 12-week Phase 2 study and one 52-week Phase 3 study\nh Among subjects in the 2 Phase 3 studies who stopped adalimumab treatment for up to 24 weeks and in whom adalimumab serum levels subsequently declined to <2 mcg/mL (approximately 22% of total subjects studied)\ni No apparent association between antibody development and safety was observed\nj No correlation of antibody development to safety or efficacy outcomes was observed\nRheumatoid Arthritisa\t6 to 12 months\t5% (58/1062)\tNR\tNA\nJuvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)\t4 to 17 years of ageb\t48 weeks\t16% (27/171)\tNR\tNA\n2 to 4 years of age or \u22654 years of age and weighing <15 kg\t24 weeks\t7% (1/15)c\tNR\tNA\nPsoriatic Arthritisd\t48 weekse\t13% (24/178)\tNR\tNA\nAnkylosing Spondylitis\t24 weeks\t9% (16/185)\tNR\tNA\nAdult Crohn's Disease\t56 weeks\t3% (7/269)\t8% (7/86)\tNA\nPediatric Crohn's Disease\t52 weeks\t3% (6/182)\t10% (6/58)\tNA\nAdult Ulcerative Colitis\t52 weeks\t5% (19/360)\t21% (19/92)\tNA\nPlaque Psoriasisf\tUp to 52 weeksg\t8% (77/920)\t21% (77/372)\tNA\nHidradenitis Suppurativa\t36 weeks\t7% (30/461)\t28% (58/207)h\t61% (272/445)i\nNon-infectious Uveitis\t52 weeks\t5% (12/249)\t21% (12/57)\t40% (99/249)j\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Subjects in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to adalimumab using the ELISA during the 6- to 12-month period. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products.

{"prompt": "What interactions does Adalimumab Injection have?", "completion": "7.1 Methotrexate\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-adbm or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Biological Products\n\nIn clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-adbm with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11)]. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-adbm and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-adbm with other biologic DMARDs (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.\n7.3 Live Vaccines\n\nAvoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-adbm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\n7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates\n\nThe formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-adbm in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."}

{"prompt": "What are the side effects of Adalimumab-ryvk?", "completion": "The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:\nSerious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\nMalignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\nHypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\nHepatitis B Virus Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\nNeurologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]\nHematological Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]\nHeart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]\nAutoimmunity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)]\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nThe most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo-controlled trials, 20% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of subjects receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.\n\nThe proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of studies in subjects with RA (i.e., Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-IV) was 7% for subjects taking adalimumab and 4% for placebo-treated subjects. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of adalimumab in these RA studies were clinical flare reaction (0.7%), rash (0.3%) and pneumonia (0.3%).\n\nInfections\n\nIn the controlled portions of the 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV, the rate of serious infections was 4.3 per 100 patient-years in 7973 adalimumab-treated subjects versus a rate of 2.9 per 100 patient-years in 4848 control-treated subjects. Serious infections observed included pneumonia, septic arthritis, prosthetic and post-surgical infections, erysipelas, cellulitis, diverticulitis, and pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\nTuberculosis and Opportunistic Infections\n\nIn 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials in RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV that included 24,605 adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active tuberculosis was 0.20 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.09 per 100 patient-years. In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated subjects, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years. Some cases of serious opportunistic infections and TB have been fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\nAutoantibodies\n\nIn the rheumatoid arthritis controlled trials, 12% of subjects treated with adalimumab and 7% of placebo-treated subjects that had negative baseline ANA titers developed positive titers at week 24. Two subjects out of 3046 treated with adalimumab developed clinical signs suggestive of new-onset lupus-like syndrome. The subjects improved following discontinuation of therapy. No subjects developed lupus nephritis or central nervous system symptoms. The impact of long-term treatment with adalimumab products on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown.\n\nLiver Enzyme Elevations\n\nThere have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in subjects receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in subjects with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects. Since many of these subjects in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.5% of control-treated subjects (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in subjects with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to <4 years.\n\nIn controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.9% of control-treated subjects. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of subjects, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these subjects discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult subjects with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.0% of control-treated subjects. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in subjects with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations \u22653 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 1.8% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult subjects with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated subjects, respectively, ALT elevations \u2265 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 2.4% of control-treated subjects.\n\nOther Adverse Reactions\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Studies\n\nThe data described below reflect exposure to adalimumab in 2468 subjects, including 2073 exposed for 6 months, 1497 exposed for greater than one year and 1380 in adequate and well-controlled studies (Studies RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV). Adalimumab was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials and in long-term follow up studies for up to 36 months duration. The population had a mean age of 54 years, 77% were female, 91% were Caucasian and had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.

Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 subjects who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of subjects within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, 45% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab-treated subjects were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA subjects who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in subjects receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment.\n\nIn the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of subjects and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash.\n\nIn Study JIA-I, 10% of subjects treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No subject developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial.\n\nApproximately 15% of subjects treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several subjects. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all subjects. Most subjects were able to continue adalimumab without interruption.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 subjects who were 2 to <4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing <15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this population was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, 78% of subjects experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of subjects receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella.\n\nIn Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of subjects and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.\n\nPsoriatic Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 395 subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in two placebo-controlled trials and in an open label study and in 393 subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in two placebo-controlled studies [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)]. The safety profile for subjects with PsA and AS treated with adalimumab 40 mg every other week was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA, adalimumab Studies RA-I through IV.\n\nCrohn\u2019s Disease Clinical Studies\n\nAdults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1478 adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease from four placebo-controlled and two open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.5)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n\nPediatric Patients 6 Years to 17 Years: The safety profile of adalimumab in 192 pediatric subjects from one double-blind study (Study PCD-I) and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] was similar to the safety profile seen in adult subjects with Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nDuring the 4-week open label induction phase of Study PCD-I, the most common adverse reactions occurring in the pediatric population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (6% and 5%, respectively).\n\nA total of 67% of children experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included upper respiratory tract infection and nasopharyngitis.\n\nA total of 5% of children experienced a serious infection while receiving adalimumab in Study PCD-I. These included viral infection, device related sepsis (catheter), gastroenteritis, H1N1 influenza, and disseminated histoplasmosis.\n\nIn Study PCD-I, allergic reactions were observed in 5% of children which were all non-serious and were primarily localized reactions.\n\nUlcerative Colitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdults: The safety profile of adalimumab in 1010 adult subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from two placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.7)] was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n\nPlaque Psoriasis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 1696 subjects with plaque psoriasis (Ps) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies [see Clinical Studies (14.8)]. The safety profile for subjects with Ps treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA with the following exceptions. In the placebo-controlled portions of the clinical trials in Ps subjects, adalimumab-treated subjects had a higher incidence of arthralgia when compared to controls (3% vs. 1%).\n\nHidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 727 subjects with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in three placebo-controlled studies and one open-label extension study [see Clinical Studies (14.9)]. The safety profile for subjects with HS treated with adalimumab weekly was consistent with the known safety profile of adalimumab.\n\nFlare of HS, defined as \u226525% increase from baseline in abscesses and inflammatory nodule counts and with a minimum of 2 additional lesions, was documented in 22 (22%) of the 100 subjects who were withdrawn from adalimumab treatment following the primary efficacy timepoint in two studies.\n\nUveitis Clinical Studies\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in 464 adult subjects with uveitis (UV) in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies and in 90 pediatric subjects with uveitis (Study PUV-I) [see Clinical Studies (14.10, 14.11)]. The safety profile for subjects with UV treated with adalimumab was similar to the safety profile seen in subjects with RA.\n6.2 Immunogenicity\n\nThe observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of adalimumab or of other adalimumab products.\n\nThere are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were <2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in Table 2.\n\nTable 2.

No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, subjects receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In subjects receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive subjects than among antibody-negative subjects. The long-term immunogenicity of adalimumab products is unknown.\n6.3 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of adalimumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to adalimumab products exposure.\n\nGastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis\n\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia\n\nHepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis\n\nImmune system disorders: Sarcoidosis\n\nNeoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin)\n\nNervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), cerebrovascular accident\n\nRespiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism\n\nSkin reactions: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all sub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia, lichenoid skin reaction\n\nVascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis"}
{"prompt": "What interactions does Adalimumab-ryvk have?", "completion": "7.1 Methotrexate\n\nAdalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either Adalimumab-ryvk or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Biological Products\n\nIn clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of Adalimumab-ryvk with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11)]. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of Adalimumab-ryvk and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV. Concomitant administration of Adalimumab-ryvk with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.\n7.3 Live Vaccines\n\nAvoid the use of live vaccines with Adalimumab-ryvk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].\n7.4 Cytochrome P450 Substrates\n\nThe formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Adalimumab-ryvk in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed."}

By Week 96, 2% of adefovir dipivoxil-treated patients, by Kaplan-Meier estimate, had increases in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline (no placebo-controlled results were available for comparison beyond Week 48). For patients who chose to continue adefovir dipivoxil for up to 240 weeks in Study 438, 4 of 125 patients (3%) had a confirmed increase of 0.5 mg/dL from baseline. The creatinine elevation resolved in 1 patient who permanently discontinued treatment and remained stable in 3 patients who continued treatment. For 65 patients who chose to continue adefovir dipivoxil for up to 240 weeks in Study 437, 6 had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline with 2 patients discontinuing from the study due to the elevated serum creatinine concentration. See Adverse Reactions (6.2) for changes in serum creatinine in patients with underlying renal insufficiency at baseline.\n6.2 Special Risk Patients\n\nPre- and Post-Liver Transplantation Patients\n\nAdditional adverse reactions observed from an open-label study (Study 435) in pre- and post-liver transplantation patients with chronic hepatitis B and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B administered adefovir dipivoxil once daily for up to 203 weeks include: abnormal renal function, renal failure, vomiting, rash, and pruritus.\n\nChanges in renal function occurred in pre-and post-liver transplantation patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction, including concomitant use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus, renal insufficiency at baseline, hypertension, diabetes, and on-study transplantation. Therefore, the contributory role of adefovir dipivoxil to these changes in renal function is difficult to assess.\n\nIncreases in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL from baseline were observed in 37% and 53% of pre-liver transplantation patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Increases in serum creatinine greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL from baseline were observed in 32% and 51% of post-liver transplantation patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Serum phosphorus values less than 2 mg/dL were observed in 3/226 (1.3%) of pre-liver transplantation patients and in 6/241 (2.5%) of post-liver transplantation patients by last study visit. Four percent (19 of 467) of patients discontinued treatment with adefovir dipivoxil due to renal adverse events.\n6.3 Pediatric Patients\n\nAssessment of adverse reactions is based on a placebo-controlled study (Study 518) in which 173 pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years with chronic hepatitis B and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with adefovir dipivoxil (N=115), or placebo (N=58) for 48 weeks [See Clinical Studies (14.4) and Use In Specific Populations (8.4)].\n\nThe safety profile of adefovir dipivoxil in patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (N=56) was similar to that observed in adults.

The population (Adempas: n = 490; Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].\n\nThe safety profile of Adempas in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH (PATENT-1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo-controlled trials for PAH and CTEPH respectively were pooled, and those occurring more frequently on Adempas than placebo (\u22653%) are displayed in Table 1 below. Most adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of Adempas.\n\nThe overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pivotal placebo-controlled trials were 2.9% for Adempas and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data).\n\nTable 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring More Frequently (\u22653%) on Adempas than Placebo (Pooled from CHEST-1 and PATENT-1)\n\nAdverse Reactions\n\n\t\n\nAdempas %\n\n(n=490)\n\n\t\n\nPlacebo %\n\n(n=214)\n\n\n\n\nHeadache\n\n\t\n\n27\n\n\t\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nDyspepsia and Gastritis\n\n\t\n\n21\n\n\t\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nDizziness\n\n\t\n\n20\n\n\t\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nNausea\n\n\t\n\n14\n\n\t\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nDiarrhea\n\n\t\n\n12\n\n\t\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nHypotension\n\n\t\n\n10\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nVomiting\n\n\t\n\n10\n\n\t\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nAnemia\n(including laboratory parameters)\n\n\t\n\n7\n\n\t\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\t\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nConstipation\n\n\t\n\n5\n\n\t\n\n1\n\nOther events that were seen more frequently in Adempas compared to placebo and potentially related to treatment were: palpitations, nasal congestion, epistaxis, dysphagia, abdominal distension and peripheral edema.

Do not administer within 24 hours of sildenafil. Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Clinical experience with co-administration of Adempas and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example, milrinone, cilostazole, roflumilast) is limited.\n7.2 Pharmacokinetic Interactions with Adempas\n\nSmoking: Plasma concentrations in smokers are reduced by 50% to 60% compared to nonsmokers. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, for patients who are smokers, doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day may be considered in order to match exposure seen in nonsmoking patients. Safety and effectiveness of Adempas doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day have not been established. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who stop smoking [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\nStrong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors: Concomitant use of riociguat with strong cytochrome CYP inhibitors and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (such as ritonavir) increase riociguat exposure and may result in hypotension. Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg 3 times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of riociguat [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\nStrong CYP3A inducers: Strong inducers of CYP3A (for example, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce riociguat exposure. Data are not available to guide dosing of riociguat when strong CYP3A inducers are co-administered. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\nAntacids: Antacids such as aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide decrease riociguat absorption and should not be taken within 1 hour of taking Adempas [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."}

The study was conducted in healthy male (63%) and female (37%) active duty US Army and Navy military recruits during their basic training. The population had a mean age of 21 years, with an age range of 17 to 42 years. Race was 62% Caucasian, 18% African-American, 11% Hispanic, 3% Asian and 6% other. Subjects in both groups were administered other vaccines concomitantly with Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral. The specific vaccines that each subject received varied and were dependent on their immunization history. The vaccines that were co-administered included Hepatitis A Vaccine, Inactivated (Merck & Co., Inc.), Hepatitis A Inactivated and Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) (Merck & Co., Inc.), Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Vaccine, Recombinant (Merck & Co., Inc.), Influenza Vaccine, Live, Intranasal (MedImmune, LLC), Influenza Virus Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live (Merck & Co., Inc.), Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide, Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Combined) (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.), Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated (Sanofi Pasteur, SA), Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (Sanofi Pasteur, Ltd.), Tetanus Toxoid, Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, SA), Varicella Virus Vaccine Live (Merck & Co., Inc.), Yellow Fever Vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc.).\n\nSerious Adverse Events\n\nNo deaths were reported during the multicenter safety and efficacy trial.\n\nSerious adverse events in vaccine recipients included hematuria, gastroenteritis, febrile gastroenteritis, gastritis, pneumonia, and hematochezia.\n\nFifty-seven serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the six month study period with 39 reported between 0 and 56 days following treatment and 18 reported during the 56 to 180 day follow-up period. Thirty-five subjects (1.2%) who received vaccine (25 between 0 and 56 days from the date of vaccination, 10 during the 56 to 180 day follow-up period) and 12 subjects (1.2%) who received placebo (9 between 0 and 56 days from the date of treatment, 3 during the 56 to 180 day follow-up period) experienced at least one SAE. The SAEs occurring between Day 0 and Day 56 post-vaccination in the vaccine group, possibly associated with the receipt of the vaccine product as determined by the investigator, were as follows: one subject with hematuria and gastroenteritis (at 9 days post vaccination), one subject with febrile gastroenteritis (at 4 days post vaccination, one subject with gastritis (at 23 days post vaccination), and one subject with pneumonia (at 23 days post vaccination); one SAE (hematochezia) in the vaccine group occurred during the 56 to 180 day follow-up period and was determined to be possibly related to the vaccine product. A placebo recipient developed febrile acute respiratory disease where adenovirus Type 4 vaccine strain was detected from posterior pharyngeal and tonsillar swabbing and characterized by serotyping and polymerase chain reaction analysis [See Warnings and Precautions: Shedding and Transmission (5.2)].\n\nOverall, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one adverse event during the 56 day study period was 91.2% in the Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral group compared to 93.9% in the placebo group. No subject in either treatment arm discontinued the study due to an adverse event. Adverse reactions were captured on a 2-Week Daily Diary (for a minimum of the first 780 subjects) or a 1-Week Daily Diary (for all remaining subjects) and were also reported at each study visit up to Day 56 after vaccination. Any reported AEs for Days 0-14 for the safety cohort and for Days 0-7 for the remaining subjects were defined as \"solicited\" because they were almost exclusively recorded directly by the subject from a pre-defined diary checklist.

Labeled by FDA for use in military populations 17 through 50 years of age; not commercially available for use in other individuals. (See Restricted Distribution under Dosage and Administration.)\nAdenoviruses, especially adenovirus type 4 and type 7, commonly cause acute respiratory disease (e.g., runny nose, fever, sore throat, breathing problems, cough, headache, croup, bronchitis). Certain adenovirus serotypes cause other illnesses (e.g., conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, otitis media, gastroenteritis, cystitis). Disseminated or life-threatening infections can occur (e.g., severe pneumonia, hepatitis, meningitis, encephalitis). Adenoviruses spread person to person via direct contact, respiratory droplet transmission, or food and/or water contaminated with feces. Fomites also may be involved in transmission since adenoviruses survive for long periods outside of the body, including on environmental surfaces, and are unusually stable when exposed to chemical and physical agents or adverse pH conditions.\nMilitary recruits are at increased risk of acute respiratory illnesses during basic training because of several factors, including close sleeping and training environments where transmission of respiratory pathogens is facilitated, congregation of young adults arriving from wide geographic distributions who may enter basic training carrying pathogens capable of being spread to others who are immunologically susceptible, and stressful nature of basic training and military operations. Adenoviruses, especially adenovirus type 4 and type 7, are a well documented cause of acute respiratory illness in military recruits; adenoviruses reportedly cause 50\u201380% of cases of acute respiratory disease in this population. Outbreaks of adenovirus-associated disease also occur in other populations (e.g., healthcare-associated outbreaks), but the combination of sustained transmission and relatively high and predictable attack rates of adenovirus-associated respiratory disease appears to be unique to military basic trainees.\nUS Department of Defense (DOD) requires that all enlisted US military recruits 17 through 50 years of age receive a single dose of adenovirus type 4 and type 7 vaccine live oral at the earliest opportunity upon arrival at initial entry training (basic military training), unless contraindicated (see Contraindications under Cautions). May also be recommended for other military personnel at high risk for adenovirus infection, but not required for cadre working at enlisted basic training sites."}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Adynovate?", "completion": "Antihemophilic factor (AHF) injection is used to treat, control, prevent, and decrease the frequency of bleeding episodes, and prevent bleeding during surgery in patients with hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency).\nAntihemophilic factor (AHF) is a protein that is produced naturally in the body. It helps the blood form clots to stop bleeding and prevents bleeding problems from happening as often.\nHemophilia A, also called classical hemophilia, is a condition where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.\nThere are several different types of AHF. They are made from human blood or artificially by a man-made process (recombinant). AHF made from human blood has been treated and is not likely to contain harmful viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The man-made AHF products do not contain these viruses.\nThis medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription."}

Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below by body system:\n\nCardiovascular: angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, pallor, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and ventricular ectopy.\n\nAngina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\nArrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have occurred, particularly in patients with underlying organic heart disease or patients receiving drugs that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\nRapid rises in blood pressure associated with epinephrine use have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\nRespiratory: respiratory difficulties.\n\nNeurological: dizziness , disorientation , excitability , headache , impaired memory , lightheadedness , nervousness , panic, psychomotor agitation, sleepiness , tingling , tremor, and weakness.\n\nPsychiatric: anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness.\n\nGastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting.\n\nOther:\n\nPatients with Parkinson's disease may experience psychomotor agitation or a temporary worsening of symptoms [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\nDiabetic patients may experience transient increases in blood sugar [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].\n\nAccidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Adverse events experienced as a result of an injection into these areas include increased heart rate, local reactions including injection site pallor, coldness, hypoesthesia, and tissue loss, or injury at the injection site resulting in bruising, bleeding, discoloration, erythema, and skeletal injury.\n\nInjection into the buttock has resulted in cases of gas gangrene [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].\n\nRare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported following epinephrine injection in the thigh [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .\n\nSkin: sweating.\n6.2 Adverse Reactions Associated with Intraocular Use (for Mydriasis)\n\nEpinephrine containing sodium bisulfite has been associated with corneal endothelial damage when used in the eye at undiluted concentrations (1 mg/mL).\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."}
{"prompt": "What interactions does Adyphren II have?", "completion": "Epinephrine should be administered cautiously to patients taking other sympathomimetic agents because of the possibility of additive effects.\nPatients who are concomitantly receiving cardiac glycosides, digitalis, diuretics, quinidine, and other antiarrhythmics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\nAdminister epinephrine cautiously to patients receiving halogenated hydrocarbon general anesthetics, such as halothane, as coadministration may result in arrhythmias.\nThe effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), levothyroxine sodium, and certain antihistamines, notably diphenhydramine, tripelannamine, and dexchlorpheniramine.\nThe cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, such as propranolol.\nThe vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine are antagonized by alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs, such as phentolamine.\nErgot alkaloids may reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine.\nEpinephrine should not be used to counteract circulatory collapse or hypotension caused by phenothiazines, as a reversal of the pressor effects of epinephrine may result in further lowering of blood pressure."}

The adverse reactions of MAS ER capsules in these adequate and well-controlled studies are described below.\n\nThe premarketing development program for MAS ER included exposures in a total of 1315 participants in clinical trials (635 pediatric patients, 350 adolescent patients, 248 adult patients, and 82 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 635 patients (ages 6 to 12) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies, one open-label clinical study, and two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies (N= 40).\n\nAdverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment\n\nThe most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MAS ER in controlled and uncontrolled, multiple-dose clinical trials of pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N=595) were anorexia (loss of appetite) (2.9%), insomnia (1.5%), weight loss (1.2%), emotional lability (1%), and depression (0.7%).\n\nIn a separate placebo-controlled 4-week study in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years with ADHD, five patients (2.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=233) compared to none who received placebo (N=54). The most frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) was insomnia (1.3%, n=3).\n\nIn one placebo-controlled 4-week study among adults with ADHD with doses 20 mg to 60 mg, 23 patients (12.0%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=191) compared to one patient (1.6%) who received placebo (N=64). The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (5.2%, n=10), anxiety (2.1%, n=4), nervousness (1.6%, n=3), dry mouth (1.6%, n=3), anorexia (1.6%, n=3), tachycardia (1.6%, n=3), headache (1.6%, n=3), and asthenia (1.0%, n=2).\n\nAdverse Reactions Occurring in Controlled Trials\n\nAdverse reactions reported in a 3-week clinical trial of pediatric patients 6 to 12 years and a 4-week clinical trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults, respectively, treated with MAS ER or placebo are presented in the tables below.\n\nTable 2: Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Children (6-12 years old) Receiving MAS ER with Higher Incidence than on Placebo in a 584-Patient Clinical Study\nBody System\tPreferred Term\tMAS ER\n(n=374)\tPlacebo\n(n=210)\nGeneral\tAbdominal Pain (stomachache)\t14%\t10%\n\tFever\t5%\t2%\n\tInfection\t4%\t2%\n\tAccidental Injury\t3%\t2%\n\tAsthenia (fatigue)\t2%\t0%\nDigestive System\tLoss of Appetite\t22%\t2%\n\tVomiting\t7%\t4%\n\tNausea\t5%\t3%\n\tDyspepsia\t2%\t1%\nNervous System\tInsomnia\t17%\t2%\n\tEmotional Lability\t9%\t2%\n\tNervousness\t6%\t2%\n\tDizziness\t2%\t0%\nMetabolic/Nutritional\tWeight Loss\t4%\t0%\nTable 3: Adverse Reactions Reported by 5% or More of Adolescents (13-17 Years Old) Weighing \u2264 75kg Receiving MAS ER with Higher Incidence than Placebo in a 287 Patient Clinical Forced Weekly-Dose Titration Study *\nBody System\tPreferred Term\tMAS ER\n(n=233)\tPlacebo\n(n=54)\nNote: The following reactions did not meet the criterion for inclusion in Table 3 but were reported by 2% to 4% of adolescent patients receiving MAS ER with a higher incidence than patients receiving placebo in this study: accidental injury, asthenia (fatigue), dry mouth, dyspepsia, emotional lability, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting.\n\n*\nIncluded doses up to 40 mg\n\u2020\nDose-related adverse reactions\n\nGeneral\tAbdominal Pain (stomachache)\t11%\t2%\nDigestive System\tLoss of Appetite \u2020\t36%\t2%\nNervous System\tInsomnia \u2020\t12%\t4%\nMetabolic/Nutritional\tWeight Loss \u2020\t9%\t0%\nTable 4: Adverse Reactions Reported by 5% or More of Adults Receiving MAS ER with Higher Incidence Than Placebo in a 255 Patient Clinical Forced Weekly-Dose Titration Study *\nBody System\tPreferred Term\tMAS ER\n(n=191)\tPlacebo\n(n=64)\nNote: The following reactions did not meet the criterion for inclusion in Table 4 but were reported by 2% to 4% of adult patients receiving MAS ER with a higher incidence than patients receiving placebo in this study: infection, photosensitivity reaction, constipation, tooth disorder (e.g. teeth clenching, tooth infection), emotional lability, libido decreased, somnolence, speech disorder (e.g., stuttering, excessive speech), palpitation, twitching, dyspnea, sweating, dysmenorrhea, and impotence.\n\n*\nIncluded doses up to 60 mg.\n\nGeneral\tHeadache\t26%\t13%\n\tAsthenia\t6%\t5%\nDigestive System\tDry Mouth\t35%\t5%\n\tLoss of Appetite\t33%\t3%\n\tNausea\t8%\t3%\n\tDiarrhea\t6%\t0%\nNervous System\tInsomnia\t27%\t13%\n\tAgitation\t8%\t5%\n\tAnxiety\t8%\t5%\n\tDizziness\t7%\t0%\nCardiovascular System\tTachycardia\t6%\t3%\nMetabolic/Nutritional\tWeight Loss\t10%\t0%\nUrogenital System\tUrinary Tract Infection\t5%\t0%\n6.2 Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials and Spontaneous Postmarketing Reports of Other Amphetamine Products\n\nThe following adverse reactions are from clinical trials and spontaneous postmarketing reports of other amphetamine products in pediatric patients and adults with ADHD.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Afeditab CR?", "completion": "Nifedipine is used alone or together with other medicines to treat severe chest pain (angina) or high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. High blood pressure may also increase the risk of heart attacks. These problems may be less likely to occur if blood pressure is controlled.\nNifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. It works by affecting the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, nifedipine relaxes blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.\nThis medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription."}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Afluria?", "completion": "Afluria is a brand of influenza virus vaccine (injectable).\nAfluria (influenza virus vaccine) is used to prevent infection caused by influenza virus. The vaccine is redeveloped each year to contain specific strains of inactivated (killed) flu virus that are recommended by public health officials for that year.\nInfluenza virus (commonly known as \"the flu\") is a serious disease caused by a virus. Influenza virus can spread from one person to another through small droplets of saliva that are expelled into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also be passed through contact with objects the infected person has touched, such as a door handle or other surfaces.\nAfluria vaccine (flu shot) is a \"killed virus\" vaccine. Afluria works by exposing you to a small dose of the virus, which helps your body to develop immunity to the disease. Afluria vaccine will not treat an active infection that has already developed in the body.\nAfluria is for use in adults and children who are at least 6 months old.\nBecoming infected with influenza is much more dangerous to your health than receiving Afluria vaccine. Influenza causes thousands of deaths each year, and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. However, like any medicine, Afluria can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.\nLike any vaccine, Afluria may not provide protection from disease in every person.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Afluria 2015-2016 Formula?", "completion": "Influenza virus vaccine is used to prevent infection by the influenza viruses. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. It is also known as a \u201cflu shot\u201d.\nThere are many kinds of influenza viruses, but not all will cause problems in any given year. Therefore, before the influenza vaccine is produced each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. and Canadian Public Health Services decide which viruses will most likely cause influenza infections for that year. The antigens, which are substances that cause protective antibodies to be formed, for these viruses are included in the influenza vaccine. Usually, the U.S. and Canada use the same influenza vaccine, however, they are not required to do so.\nIt is necessary to receive an influenza vaccine injection each year, since influenza infections are usually caused by different kinds of viruses and the protection gained by the vaccine lasts for less than a year.\nInfluenza is a virus infection of the throat, bronchial tubes, and lungs. It causes fever, chills, cough, headache, muscle aches, and pains in your back, arms, and legs. In addition, adults and children weakened by other diseases or medical conditions, and persons 50 years of age and older, even if they are healthy, may get a much more serious illness that may have to be treated in a hospital. Each year, thousands of people die as a result of an influenza infection.\nThe best way to help prevent influenza infections is to get an influenza vaccination each year, usually in early November. Immunization (getting a vaccine) against influenza is approved for infants 6 months of age and older, all children, and all adults (including 65 years of age and older).\nThis vaccine is to be given only by or under the direct supervision of your doctor or other health care professional."}

Although only 10 out of every one million people who received the vaccine actually developed GBS, this number was 6 times higher than would normally have been expected. Most of the people who got GBS recovered completely.\nIt is assumed that the \u201cswine flu\u201d virus included in the 1976 vaccine caused the problem, but this has not been proven.

The mean age of the population was 58 years, 57% were female, and racial groups consisted of 82% White, 16% Black, and 2% other; 5% of subjects were Hispanic/Latino. The age sub-groups were 18 through 64 years and 65 years and older with mean ages of 43 years and 73 years, respectively. In this study, AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT and comparator trivalent influenza vaccines were administered by needle and syringe (see Clinical Studies [14]).\n\nLocal (injection-site) adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were solicited for 7 days post-vaccination (Table 2). Injection site cellulitis, cellulitis-like reactions (defined as concurrent Grade 3 pain, redness, and swelling/lump), and Grade 3 swelling/lump were monitored for 28 days post-vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events were collected for 28 days post-vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs), including deaths, were collected for 180 days post-vaccination.\n\nTable 2: Proportion of Subjects Per Age Cohort with Any Solicited Local Adverse Reactions or Systemic Adverse Events within 7 Days after Administration of AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT or Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (Study 1) a\n\nAbbreviations: Gr 3, Grade 3.\n\n\n\n\na NCT02214225\n\n\n\n\nb Proportion of subjects reporting each solicited local adverse reaction or systemic adverse event by study vaccine group based on the number of subjects contributing any follow up safety information for at least one data value of an individual sign/symptom.\n\n\n\n\nc N = number of subjects in the Safety Population for each study vaccine group.\n\n\n\n\nd Local adverse reactions: Grade 3 pain is that which prevents daily activity; Swelling/Lump and redness: any = \u2265 20mm diameter, Grade 3 = \u2265 100mm diameter.\n\n\n\n\ne Systemic adverse events: Fever: any = \u2265 100.4\u00b0F (Oral), Grade 3 = \u2265 102.2\u00b0F (Oral); Grade 3 for all other adverse events is that which prevents daily activity.\n\n\n\tPercentage (%) b of Subjects in each Age Cohort Reporting an Event\nSubjects 18 through 64 years\tSubjects \u2265 65 years\nAFLURIA Quadrivalent\nN=854 c\tTIV-1\nN=428 c\tTIV-2\nN=430 c\tAFLURIA Quadrivalent\nN=867 c\tTIV-1\nN=436 c\tTIV-2\nN=434 c\nAny\tGr 3\tAny\tGr 3\tAny\tGr 3\tAny\tGr 3\tAny\tGr 3\tAny\tGr 3\nLocal Adverse Reactions d\nPain\t47.9\t0.7\t43.7\t1.4\t50.7\t1.2\t24.6\t0.1\t22.7\t0\t21.0\t0.2\nSwelling/Lump\t3.7\t0.1\t2.3\t0\t3.5\t0.2\t3.2\t0.5\t1.8\t0\t1.6\t0\nRedness\t2.9\t0\t2.8\t0\t2.8\t0\t4.2\t0.3\t2.1\t0\t2.5\t0.2\nSystemic Adverse Events e\nMyalgia (muscle ache)\t25.5\t1.9\t23.4\t1.4\t24.2\t1.2\t12.7\t0.3\t14.0\t0.7\t12.2\t0.5\nHeadache\t21.7\t1.7\t15.2\t0.9\t19.1\t1.2\t8.4\t0\t7.1\t0.2\t7.8\t0.7\nMalaise\t8.9\t0.7\t9.1\t0\t9.3\t0.7\t4.4\t0.5\t5.0\t0.2\t5.1\t0.2\nNausea\t6.9\t0.6\t7.7\t0.5\t6.3\t1.2\t1.6\t0\t1.8\t0\t2.1\t0.2\nChills\t4.8\t0.6\t4.4\t0.2\t4.7\t0.5\t2.0\t0\t2.1\t0.5\t1.4\t0.2\nVomiting\t1.5\t0.4\t0.9\t0\t2.3\t0.7\t0.5\t0.1\t0\t0\t0.7\t0.2\nFever\t1.1\t0.4\t0.9\t0\t0.5\t0\t0.2\t0\t0.9\t0\t0.5\t0.2\n\nIn the 28 days following vaccination, no subject experienced cellulitis or a cellulitis-like reaction.

The majority of SAEs occurred after Study Day 28 and in subjects \u2265 65 years of age who had co-morbid illnesses. No SAEs or deaths appeared related to the study vaccines.\n\nSafety information has also been collected in a clinical study of AFLURIA (trivalent formulation) administered using the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System (Study 2). Study 2 included 1,247 subjects for safety analysis, ages 18 through 64 years, randomized to receive AFLURIA by either the PharmaJet Stratis Needle-Free Injection System (624 subjects) or needle and syringe (623 subjects). No deaths or vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported in Study 2.

Subjects were stratified into one of two age cohorts of 5 through 8 years or 9 through 17 years (51.2% and 48.8% of the study population, respectively). The mean age of the population was 9.5 years, 52.1% were male, and racial groups consisted of 73.3% White, 20.7% Black, 0.8% Asian, 0.3% American Indian/Native American, and 0.7% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; 23.8% of subjects were Hispanic/Latino. The mean ages of subjects 5 through 8 years and 9 through 17 years were 6.7 years and 12.5 years, respectively. Subjects in the safety population (N=2252) received either AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT (N=1692) or a U.S.-licensed comparator quadrivalent influenza vaccine (N=560). Study subjects were scheduled to receive either a single vaccination or two vaccinations 28 days apart based on their previous vaccination history. In this study, AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT and comparator vaccine were administered by needle and syringe (see Clinical Studies [14]).\n\nLocal (injection site) adverse reactions and systemic adverse events were solicited for 7 days post-vaccination. Cellulitis-like reactions (defined as concurrent Grade 3 pain, redness, and swelling/lump) at the injection site were monitored for 28 days post-vaccination. Subjects were instructed to report and return to clinic within 24 hours in the event of a cellulitis-like reaction. Unsolicited adverse events were collected for 28 days post-vaccination.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of African Basil?", "completion": "Anti-inflammatory activity\n\nAnimal and in vitro data\nIn models of respiratory allergy (in vitro experiments evaluating effects on airway epithelial cells, in vivo studies in rodents), O. gratissimum demonstrated effects on markers of inflammation, including interleukins, protein kinases, and leukocytes/eosinophils.(Costa 2012, Jiao 2013)\nIn mouse paw edema studies, ethanol and aqueous extracts of O. suave demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity.(Masresha 2012) Limited studies in rodents suggest antinociceptive activity of O. gratissimum extracts and essential oil, which may be mediated through the opioid and endocannabinoid systems.(Paula-Freire 2013, Paula-Freire 2014) A study in mice found that antinociceptive activity of a flavonoid-rich ethylacetate fraction of O. gratissimum was not reversed by naloxone or atropine, but was reversed by yohimbine and L-NAME, indicating a mechanism involving adrenergic and nitric oxide pathways.(Ajayi 2021)\n\nAntimicrobial activity\n\nAnimal and in vitro data\nAntimicrobial activity against relevant human pathogens (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Vibrio spp., periodontopathic organisms) has been demonstrated.(Adesina 2015, Igbinosa 2016, Nweze 2009, Ocheng 2015, Tibyangye 2015) Antifungal activity of the essential oil has also been observed in vitro.(Nweze 2009, Prakash 2011)\n\nClinical data\nA small clinical study evaluated the effect of an O. gratissimum mouthwash in reducing gingivitis. Plaque and bleeding were reduced in both the test and control groups, with O. gratissimum demonstrating equivalence to the chlorhexidine used in control subjects.(Pereira 2011)\n\nCancer\n\nIn vitro data\nActivity against certain cancer cell lines(Nangia-Makker 2013, Pandey 2015) and antisickling activity of ursolic acid isolated from O. gratissimum have been demonstrated.(Tshilanda 2015) In human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, an aqueous O. gratissimum extract increased tumor apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with little to no effect on noncancerous Chang liver cells.(Huang 2020)\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nAnimal data\nIn a study in rats, O. gratissimum essential oil demonstrated endothelium-dependent, vasorelaxant effects and decreased perfusion pressure in isolated mesenteric vascular beds.(Pires 2012)\nAn extract of O. gratissimum attenuated induced cardiac abnormalities associated with liver fibrosis in rats, possibly by influencing the interleukin-6 signaling pathway(Li 2012) or by inducing antioxidant effects.(Chiu 2014)\nIn Wistar rats, O. gratissimum extracts reversed toxicity and blood pressure changes associated with cobalt chloride exposure, indicating a protective effect.(Akinrinde 2016)\n\nControlled drug delivery\n\nIn vitro data\nO. gratissimum seeds have been used in the development of orally disintegrating tablets and films and may have usefulness for controlled delivery of solid lipid particles.(Dang 2020, Mai 2020)\n\nDiabetes\n\nAnimal and in vitro data\nLimited reports in rodents suggest glucose-lowering effects of O. gratissimum extracts, indicating a propensity of O. gratissimum to reverse impairment of nutrient digestion and absorption in diabetes mellitus.(Okon 2015, Shittu 2016) In vivo and in vitro studies evaluating the constituent eugenol showed reductions in blood glucose levels, possibly due to the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase; insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels remained unchanged.(Singh 2016) In Wistar rats with dexamethasone-induced insulin resistance, O. gratissimum extract increased insulin sensitivity, resulting in decreased body weight, fasting blood glucose, and insulin.(Shittu 2021)\n\nClinical data\nA small study in normoglycemic subjects (N=27) evaluated the effect of O. gratissimum decoctions, given alone or as part of a combination decoction, on oral glucose tolerance. The O. gratissimum decoction alone did not alter peak time for the oral glucose tolerance test and did not significantly reduce blood glucose concentrations at any time point on the test curves relative to baseline.(Ejike 2013)\n\nGastric ulcers\n\nAnimal data\nIn rats with induced gastric ulcers, an aqueous leaf extract of O. gratissimum decreased gastric acid secretion and ulceration.(Ofem 2012b)\n\nPesticidal/Insecticidal activity\n\nIn vitro data\nO. gratissimum extracts have been used in topical preparations as a mosquito repellent.(Keziah 2015)\nO. gratissimum essential oil exhibited larvicidal activity against the Aedes albopictus mosquito, an important and proven viral disease vector.(Sumitha 2016)"}

It helps the blood form clots to stop bleeding and prevents bleeding problems from happening as often.\nHemophilia A, also called classical hemophilia, is a condition where the body does not make enough AHF. If you do not have enough AHF and you become injured, your blood will not form clots properly. You might bleed into and damage your muscles and joints. AHF injection is given to increase the levels of AHF in the blood.\nThere are several different types of AHF. They are made from human blood or artificially by a man-made process (recombinant). AHF made from human blood has been treated and is not likely to contain harmful viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Agrimony?", "completion": "Analgesic effects\n\nAnimal data\nIn a cisplatin-induced neuropathic rat model, an ethanolic A. eupatoria extract of aerial parts was administered orally at 200 mg/kg for 1 week. The extract improved mechanical, thermal, and cold-allodynia hyperalgesia, often as effectively as gabapentin 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection.(Lee 2016)\n\nAntibacterial activity\n\nIn vitro data\nAn aqueous extract of A. pilosa showed potent antibacterial activity against several Escherichia coli isolates and Listeria monocytogenes in vitro. Inhibitory activity of the extract against E. coli ATCC 25922 was comparable to that of ampicillin, with MICs of 7.81 and 8 mg/L, respectively.(McMurray 2020) In another study, an ethanolic crude extract of A. eupatoria was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus than Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with respective MICs of 1.25 and 3.75 mg/mL.(Mouro 2020) In a study investigating the neutralization of cholera toxin by 5 plant extracts obtained from the Rosaceae family, an aqueous extract of A. eupatoria aerial parts changed the cholera toxin structure and inhibited its binding to cell surfaces. The extract showed bactericidal activity against Vibrio cholerae at doses above those used in traditional medicine (10 mg/mL). The extract had no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus, a beneficial bacteria of the gut microbiome.(Komiazyk 2019)\n\nAntioxidant/Anti-inflammatory effects\n\nIn vitro and in vivo data\nIn a study evaluating radical scavenging activity, a 55% ethanol extract of A. pilosa exhibited antioxidant activity, with subsequent experiments identifying catechin, luteolin, quercetin, quercitrin, hyperoside, rutin, and luteolin-7-O-glucoside as the specific flavonoid compounds with the most potent activity. Half maximal inhibitory concentration values ranged from approximately 4 to 8 mcM, while the value for vitamin C was 14.62 mcM. All the flavonoid compounds showed a concentration-dependent protective effect against DNA oxidative damage.(Zhu 2017b) Antioxidant potential of the phenolic content has been determined.(Kuczmannov\u00e1 2015, Yoon 2012)\n\nClinical data\nIn a small study of 19 healthy volunteers (18 to 55 years of age) to evaluate effects of 30-day agrimony tea consumption on markers of inflammation, oxidative status, and lipid metabolism, 1 g of aerial parts of A. eupatoria was added to 200 mL of boiled water and consumed as a tea twice daily. By the end of the intervention, significant elevation of plasma total antioxidant capacity was observed (P<0.001) and interleukin 6 levels were significantly lowered (P<0.05).(Ivanova 2013)\n\nAntiviral activity\n\nIn vitro data\nA 50% aqueous ethanolic extract of A. pilosa aerial parts at concentrations of 0.1 mcg/mL and 0.5 mcg/mL significantly inhibited replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero cells compared with mock-treated controls (P<0.001). The 0.5 mcg/mL dose performed comparably to remdesivir (5 mcM) and chloroquine phosphate (10 mcM). Unlike remdesivir and chloroquine, the extract interfered with viral entry into the cell, which is key to replication. Similar results were observed with a 6:4 mixture of A. pilosa extract plus galla rhois.(Lee 2021)\n\nCancer\n\nIn vitro and in vivo data\nAntioxidant potential of the phenolic content has been determined.(Kuczmannov\u00e1 2015, Yoon 2012, Yu 2015) Cytotoxic effects of agrimony against cancer cell lines have been demonstrated in vitro.(Ad'hiah 2013) In one study, simultaneous administration of Guan Chang Fu Fang and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in a synergistic manner within the LoVo cell line. Low doses of Guan Chang Fu Fang and 5-FU induced S-phase cell cycle arrest in LoVo cells via the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Also, expression levels of certain chemotherapeutic agent resistance\u2013related genes were identified to be downregulated by Guan Chang Fu Fang alone and in combination with 5-FU.(Yu 2015)\n\nCardiovascular effects\n\nAnimal and in vitro data\nIn vitro, clotting time was prolonged in a dose-dependent manner when an A. pilosa aqueous extract at concentrations of 4 g/L, 20 g/L, and 80 g/L was mixed with plasma or whole blood samples. At 4 g/L, the extract significantly prolonged clotting time (1,100 seconds vs 310 seconds at 0 g/L); in the 80 g/L group, whole blood showed no coagulation after 1 hour. Prothrombin time and coagulation factor VII activity were reduced; activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged; and activity of coagulation factors VIII, IX, and XI were decreased with the extract, also in a concentration-dependent manner. However, thrombin time, fibrinogen levels, coagulation factor X activity, and calcium ion concentrations were not affected. Additionally, the levels of all blood viscosity markers increased with increasing A. pilosa concentrations.(Fei 2017)\nIn a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, effects of various A. pilosa extracts on protection against cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury were investigated. The 4 extraction methods were petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and water. The extracts were administered at 4 g/kg at 0 and 6 hours after occlusion. All 4 extracts resulted in significantly less mean infarction volumes than the control (29.4%), ranging from 13.5% for the water extract to 22.5% for the ethyl acetate extract (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). However, the extracts were not as effective as the positive control, nimodipine (9.2%). Only the water extract of A. pilosa demonstrated a protective effect on neurologic functional recovery (P<0.05).(Zhu 2017a)\n\nDiabetes\n\nAnimal data\nStudies in rodents suggest that the chemical constituents of agrimony have potential in diabetes.(Kuczmannov\u00e1 2016, Wang 2016) Rats fed a high-fat diet to induce glucose intolerance were treated with an aqueous extract of A. pilosa. After 16 weeks, insulin levels, insulin resistance, and liver weight significantly improved with A. pilosa and worsened in untreated rats (P<0.05). However, glucose levels remained similar among groups. The effects appeared to result from improvement in inflammatory markers (ie, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, adiponectin).(Jang 2017) In a postmenopausal metabolic syndrome rat model, A. pilosa was administered for 4 weeks to ovariectomized animals fed a high-fat diet. Supplementation with the extract significantly reduced serum glucose by 26% and improved insulin and adiponectin levels compared with untreated controls (P<0.05 for each). The atherogenic index was also significantly lower in the extract-treated group compared with untreated controls (P<0.05). A decrease in hepatic lipid droplet formation was also observed in the extract group.(Jang 2020)\n\nHepatoprotective effects\n\nAnimal data\nIn a rat model of chronic ethanol-induced liver injury, an A. eupatoria water extract attenuated increased levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 protein expression, inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein and mRNA expression, and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B. Hepatoprotective effects are likely due to suppression of oxidative stress and TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling.(Yoon 2012)\n\nClinical data\nIn a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 80 Korean adults with elevated ALT levels (45 to 135 units/L) were treated with 160 mg/day of a standardized aqueous extract of A. eupatoria aerial parts for 8 weeks. Compared with placebo, the extract significantly reduced ALT (\u221215.7% vs 2.5%; P=0.038) and AST levels (\u22126.4% vs 3.2%; P=0.04). The reduction in alkaline phosphatase was not statistically significant, and no effect was observed on gamma-glutamyltransferase or total bilirubin. Additionally, triglyceride levels were significantly reduced with A. eupatoria extract (\u221217.7 mg/dL) compared with placebo (60.7 mg/dL; P=0.01). Changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein were not significantly different from controls.(Cho 2018)\nIn a small study of 19 healthy volunteers (18 to 55 years of age) to evaluate effects of 30-day agrimony tea consumption on markers of inflammation, oxidative status, and lipid metabolism, 1 g of aerial parts of A. eupatoria was added to 200 mL of boiled water and consumed as a tea twice daily. Improvement in lipid profile (as estimated by increased HDL) was observed. No abnormal changes in AST, ALT, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities were observed at the end of the study.(Ivanova 2013)\n\nSteroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\nIn vitro data\nA water-soluble beta-glucan isolated from A. pilosa reduced dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and cell loss in murine osteoblasts. Subsequent experiments demonstrated improvements in collagen secretion, mineralization, and alkaline phosphatase activity with the extract and its sulphated derivatives, reflecting increased osteoblastogenesis.(Huang 2020)"}

{"prompt": "What are the uses of AHCC?", "completion": "The medical literature documents the use of AHCC as an immunomodulatory agent, as well as efficacy as an adjuvant in cancer treatment and various infections.\n\nCancer\nAHCC is thought to modulate tumor immune surveillance by regulating innate and adaptive immune system responses. The compound may act as a biological response modifier by enhancing natural killer cell activity, interleukin 12 (IL-12) and tumor immunity production, and spleen cell proliferation and cytokine production.Gao 2006\n\nIn vitro and animal data\nIn an in vitro study, the combination of AHCC plus UFT (tegafur and uracil in a 4:1 molar concentration) enhanced natural killer cell activity in tumor-bearing rats, while UFT treatment alone depressed the natural killer cell activity. The combination also enhanced nitric oxide production and cytotoxicity of peritoneal macrophages. In addition, AHCC restored suppressed mRNA expression of IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced by the chemotherapy and helped to reduce metastasis of rat mammary adenocarcinoma.Matsushita 1998\nIn a study in rats, AHCC partially suppressed DNA fragmentation on thymus apoptosis induced by dexamethasone. AHCC may act as an antioxidant to suppress thymic apoptosis or may stimulate the melatonin secretion that protects thymocytes.Burikhanov 2000 AHCC administration enhanced the serum levels of IL-12, a critical cytokine for immune system responses in anticancer therapy, in H-2b mice and was effective in genetically Th1 (or transcription factor T-bet)\u2013dominant mice.Yagita 2002\nAHCC may help protect against adverse reactions caused by anticancer drugs. The compound protected against alopecia in rats treated with cytosine arabinoside. Liver injury was reduced when rats treated with mercaptopurine and methotrexate were simultaneously given AHCC at a dose of 1 g/kg.Sun 1999\nCisplatin-induced antitumor activity was enhanced with AHCC treatment in a study of mice. AHCC supplementation improved the suppression of bone marrow caused by cisplatin, and histopathological examination of the kidney revealed a renal protective effect.Hirose 2007\nIn vitro treatment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer KLM1-R cells, but not high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) cells, with AHCC 10 mg/mL for 48 hours decreased protein expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which suggests that HSF1 is downregulated by AHCC. AHCC shows promise as a potential component of anticancer drug regimens for drug-resistant cancer cells.Tokunaga 2015\nIn vitro treatment of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer KLM1-R cells with AHCC 10 mg/mL reduced protein expression of the Sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2). Protein expression was not reduced in Oct4 or Nanog, which suggests that AHCC targets the downregulation of SOX2. Given these findings, AHCC may have the potential to enhance the effect(s) of chemotherapy while reducing its adverse effects, particularly in pancreatic cancer.Nawata 2014\nIn another study, gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer KLM1-R cells were treated with 0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/mL of AHCC for 48 hours. Protein expression of HSP27 was reduced with AHCC treatment; results differed based on dose, indicating a dose-dependent relationship between HSP27 protein levels and AHCC. AHCC also had a cytotoxic effect on KLM1-R cells that was higher when AHCC was combined with gemcitabine. These results indicate that AHCC downregulates expression of HSP27 and that combined treatment with gemcitabine synergistically increases the cytotoxic effect.Suenaga 2014\nOne study evaluated the activity of AHCC (50 mg/kg orally once daily for 12 weeks) alone or in combination with tamoxifen or letrozole in 2 mouse models of estrogen receptor\u2013positive breast cancer: catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (MCF-7 variant) and COMT wild-type (ZR-75 variant). The MCF-7 model showed a significant decrease in tumor growth with AHCC alone and in combination with tamoxifen. The MCF-7 model also showed a decrease in letrozole aromatase inhibitor efficacy when given in combination with AHCC, which may be due to AHCC induction of aromatase activity that decreases detoxification of oncogenic catechol estrogens. The ZR-75 model showed a decrease in tumor growth with AHCC alone and in combination with letrozole.Mathew 2017\nBoth in vitro and in mice (at a dosage of 600 mg/kg given by gavage twice per week for 2 weeks), AHCC increased Caspase-3\u2013dependent apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, as well as induced Fas and Caspase-8, both members of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This led to reduced blast counts and increased survival time in mice. With increasing doses of AHCC, there were significantly fewer colonies. Results demonstrate that AHCC has a direct effect on AML blasts, reducing viability and proliferation in AML cell lines and primary AML samples. AHCC also decreased white blood cell counts. AHCC can cause AML cell death in both MV4-11 cells as well as in primary AML samples.Fatehchand 2017\nAHCC 100 mcL (100 mg/mL concentration) dissolved in deionized distilled water was given orally to mice for 2 weeks in combination with 100 mcL (200 mcg/mL concentration) of KSK-CpG ODN, an immunological adjuvant, via intraperitoneal injection twice a week. There was a reduction in tumor size in the B16 melanoma murine model in the treatment groups. Treatment groups also displayed lower total white blood cell counts, increased production of nitric oxide, increased protein concentration of IL-10, and lower reactive oxygen species production compared to the control group.Ignacio 2015\n\nClinical data\nIn patients with malignant tumors, AHCC may increase circulating levels of TNF, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-1B.Burikhanov 2000 In a 2-week study, 3 and 6 g/day of AHCC increased natural killer cell activity in 3 patients with different types of advanced cancer: rhabdomyosarcoma, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer.Ghoneum 1992 The binding capacity of natural killer cells to tumor cells was enhanced 2-fold in 17 cancer patients with different advanced malignancies treated with 3 g/day of AHCC orally for 2 to 6 months.Ghoneum 1994 A similar 2-week study also documented a decline of tumor-associated antigens in 8 of 11 patients treated with AHCC. The mechanism of action was associated with enhanced natural killer cell activity due to an increase of natural killer cell granularity and binding capacity to tumor cell targets.Ghoneum 1995 Compared with baseline, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and natural killer cell activity all increased to normal levels after treatment with AHCC in a study of 38 patients with solid tumors.Katsuaki 2000\nAHCC may improve the prognosis in postoperative advanced liver cancer patients by reducing incidences of recurrence or death due to hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cirrhosis.Cowawintaweewat 2006, Matsui 2002\nSerologic response improved after treatment with AHCC in a 66-year-old patient with castration-resistant prostate cancer, an incurable condition with limited treatment options.Turner 2009\nOne study of 12 patients with different cancers reported that AHCC can be used to help prevent bone marrow depression resulting from chemotherapy.Won 2002\nIn one study, female patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer were given 1 g of AHCC orally after each meal to determine its effects on the adverse events associated with chemotherapy. Patients were also given dexamethasone and 5-hydroxytriptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists to prevent nausea and vomiting. The AHCC group experienced fewer adverse neutrophil events compared with the control group. The AHCC group also required less granulocyte colony-stimulating factor during taxane therapy. These results indicate that AHCC improves bone marrow suppression, although the mechanism is unclear. AHCC has the potential to increase neutrophil count during bone marrow suppression, indicating it may be possible to increase the intensity of chemotherapy sessions, potentially resulting in better clinical outcomes. This study also showed that AHCC 1 g orally administered after each meal may improve lipid abnormalities in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.Hangai 2013\nIn a study of patients with unresectable pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma, AHCC 6 g was given daily for 8 weeks along with 2 cycles of gemcitabine to assess the clinical effects of AHCC on adverse events caused by gemcitabine. Compared with the control group, patients receiving AHCC demonstrated higher hemoglobin and serum albumin levels, lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and less frequent occurrence of taste disorder. The pre-post ratio of albumin was higher with AHCC, while that of CRP was lower than in the control group. The AHCC group showed better modified Glasgow Prognostic Scores (mGPS) as well as a lower frequency of grade 3 in mGPS. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) response rates and disease control rates were better in the AHCC group. The AHCC group also demonstrated a longer median survival time and higher overall tendency for survival. These results suggest that AHCC may improve gemcitabine-induced adverse events in pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma patients.Yanagimoto 2016\nIn a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of AHCC on chemotherapy-induced adverse effects and quality of life, advanced cancer patients were given of AHCC 3 g/day orally during a course of chemotherapy. Specifically, hepatotoxicity, hematotoxicity, and DNA levels of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6; a possible biomarker of fatigue during chemotherapy) were evaluated. Results showed that in female patients, quality of life was increased and symptoms of appetite loss were improved. In all patients, AHCC reduced symptoms of fatigue. Scores for dyspnea increased after chemotherapy with AHCC supplementation. The antioxidant actions of AHCC have been determined to be moderate.Ito 2014\nIn a study evaluating the effects of AHCC on immune response and adverse events in epithelial ovarian cancer or peritoneal cancer patients taking platinum-based chemotherapy, patients were given two 500 mg AHCC capsules orally 3 times a day throughout 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Changes in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lymphocytes were not significantly different between the AHCC and placebo groups; however, CD8+ levels were significantly higher in the AHCC group at the sixth cycle of chemotherapy. Nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy decreased in the AHCC group.Suknikhom 2017\nHead and neck cancer patients were given 3 g of dried AHCC extract every morning 3 days prior to chemotherapy. The extract was well tolerated, with most patients reporting they felt better and stronger at the time of chemotherapy cycle initiation. Patients' sleep patterns were more regulated, visitor interactions increased, and appetites improved. Furthermore, a reduction in the rate of decrease in hemoglobin was observed, no patients required concentrate transfusion, and the majority of patients saw a decrease in GI-related chemotherapy adverse effects with AHCC.Parida 2011\n\nImmunomodulatory effects\n\nIn vitro and animal data\nIn a cold-induced stress mouse model for investigating effects of AHCC on Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection and immune response, mice were given AHCC 300 mg/kg orally for 31 days. An improvement in body weight gain and spleen weight gain was observed in AHCC-fed stressed mice. On day 3, the AHCC-fed mice also showed a lower intensity of C. trachomatis infection, which was further evidenced by reduced shedding from the genital tract on day 18. Levels of cytokines were also measured in vitro. There were increases in TNF-alpha and IL-6 by peritoneal cells and increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma production in splenic T cells in AHCC-fed mice. These results suggest that AHCC may restore cytokine production in stressed environments. The increase in cytokines may account for the fact that decreased C. trachomatis shedding was observed. Overall, these results suggest that AHCC restores immune system functions.Belay 2015\n\nClinical data\nIn a placebo-controlled study of healthy individuals, an AHCC dose of 4 capsules (250 mg/capsule) was taken daily for 4 weeks to evaluate its effects on seasonal suppression of immune competence. Results showed immunomodulatory effects against seasonal changes in those taking AHCC during the winter months. There was an insignificant decrease in the number of natural killer cells in the AHCC group compared to placebo, which suggests AHCC maintains the natural killer cell count during the winter months, during which natural killer cell count normally drops (as indicated by the placebo group). Subjects taking AHCC showed greater increase in natural killer cell activity compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, the AHCC group did not demonstrate altered immune competence, as measured by the score of immunological vigor, which suggests that AHCC maintains total immunity against immune suppression caused by seasonal changes. AHCC also showed promise in maintaining neutrophil and lymphocyte homeostasis, with no changes in neutrophil or lymphocyte counts observed. AHCC also showed improvement in mood compared to the placebo group, based on visual analog scale scores.Takanari 2015\nIn another study in cancer patients with increased HHV-6 levels during the first course of chemotherapy, AHCC decreased HHV-6 at the end of the second course of chemotherapy and increased quality of life in female patients. Given the fluctuations in HHV-6 levels, these results suggest that AHCC may contribute to immune-enhancing effects, resulting in inhibition of reactivation of HHV-6. The immunologically activating effects may also explain the inhibition of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and impairment of liver function that were observed.Ito 2014\nIn a study in healthy adults, an AHCC dosage of 3 g/day for 3 weeks was given to determine its effectiveness in improving immune responses to influenza vaccination. Data showed sustained levels of B cells, natural killer cells, CD4 T cells, and T cells, as well as increased antibody titers against influenza B. The AHCC group showed a trend for increased natural killer T cell fold change as well as an increase in CD8+ cytotoxic T cell fold change. More patients in the AHCC group showed improvements in their influenza B antibody titers in terms of seroprotection and seroconversion. The study results suggest that AHCC improves cell-mediated immune response after influenza vaccination.Roman 2013\n\nInfection\n\nIn vitro and animal data\nOral administration of AHCC to food-deprived mice infected with Klebsiella pneumonia promoted clearance of the bacteria and resulted in reduced bacterial load. AHCC also enhanced early immune response by increasing levels of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-12, TNF-alpha, IL-6) and chemokines (MCP-1) that promote clearance and reduction of a variety of pathogens.Aviles 2008 In other studies in mice maintained in the hindlimb-unloading model, AHCC decreased mortality, prolonged time to death, and increased clearance of K. pneumonia infection in mice.Aviles 2003, Aviles 2004 A similar study in mice reported that AHCC helped to restore immunity after trauma, infection, and food deprivation.Aviles 2006\nIn a study of mice infected with influenza virus, AHCC increased survival, enhanced natural killer cell activity in the lung and spleen, and rapidly cleared the primary influenza infection or virus from the lungs.Pescatore 2008 The compound works in a dose-dependent manner against acute influenza infection.Nogusa 2009\nAHCC may be useful as a prophylactic drug in managing patients with opportunistic infections. The survival period for mice with cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia was prolonged after oral or intraperitoneal administration of AHCC 50 or 1,000 mg/kg/day prior to Candida albicans infection. The kidneys of infected mice also had decreased viable counts of C. albicans. Oral administration of AHCC protected mice from a lethal Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and intraperitoneal administration protected mice from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.Ikeda 2003, Ishibashi 2000\nAHCC administered to aged mice with West Nile encephalitis attenuated viremia levels but resulted in no difference in mortality rate.Wang 2009\nIn a cecal ligation and puncture model of peritonitis, mice were pretreated with 1 g/kg of AHCC or water by gavage for 10 days before undergoing cecal ligation and puncture, then daily following infection. In those pretreated with AHCC, cortisol levels decreased over time in plasma and peritoneal samples, which indicates that AHCC diminishes local and systemic cortisol concentrations. AHCC also seemed to restrain systemic, but not local norepinephrine concentrations; this may prove to be a possible preventative mechanism in avoiding overstimulation of the generalized inflammatory response that leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome. A relative decrease in bacterial load and increase in neutrophil infiltration indicated an early trend toward promoting clearance of local infection.Love 2013\n\nClinical data\nClinical trials conducted in Bangkok report that HIV patients treated with AHCC demonstrated increased or maintained T-cell counts and increased natural killer cell activity; however, the details of these studies are lacking.Kenner 2001\nAHCC 3 g/day was evaluated for 12 months in 20 HIV-positive men. The results of the study were as follows: Natural killer cell activity was enhanced during the first month and peaked at the third month and remained consistent during the trial; absolute CD4+ cell counts showed a marked increase in 14 of 20 patients during the first month, which remained consistent; percentage of CD4+ cells showed no change; absolute CD8 cell counts increased in 12 of 20 patients; and CD4+/CD8+ ratio showed no change.Ghoneum 1994\nIn a study in healthy older individuals receiving AHCC, a dose of three 500 mg capsules orally twice daily for 60 days produced enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immune responses due to increased production of cytokines (IFN-gamma alone, TNF-alpha alone, or both) from T cells, which suggests a potential role for AHCC in improving host defense against infections and malignancy in humans by enhancing T-cell immune function. Effects of AHCC may last several weeks after AHCC discontinuation, based on increased levels of CD4+ 30 days after discontinuation.Yin 2010\n\nInflammatory bowel disease\n\nAnimal data\nIn rat colitis models, the anti-inflammatory effect of AHCC was comparable with sulfasalazine 200 mg/kg. AHCC reduced colonic inflammation and improved body weight, food intake, extension of necrosis, colonic weight, colonic weight-to-length ratio, expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1b, IL-1 receptor antagonist, TNF, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), and mucosal barrier defense (mucins 2 to 4 and trefoil factor 3). When assessing AHCC's effect on colonic microflora by studying the bacteria profile in feces, rats treated with AHCC had higher aerobic and lactic acid bacteria counts, and higher bifidobacteria counts, indicating potential use as a prebiotic.Daddaoua 2007\nA study in mice evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of a 75 mg/day dose of AHCC on the CD4+CD62L+ T-cell transfer model of colitis. There was a positive response to AHCC, as evidenced by a lower disease activity index, colonic myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase activities, and diminished ex vivo production of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 by mesenteric lymph node cells. There was a lower sensitivity of alkaline phosphatase activities to levamisole in vitro. AHCC also produced increased colonic expression of a variety of inflammatory markers, in particular TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Furthermore, it normalized the mRNA level increased by colitis and decreased cyclooxygenase 2. AHCC also demonstrated inhibition of STAT4 phosphorylation in splenic CD4+ cells. There were no changes in mRNA levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-1beta in spleen cells, suggesting that AHCC exerts systemic immunomodulatory effects, which possibly reduces the number of IFN-gamma\u2013producing Th1 cells. A disruption in efficient control of mucosa-invading microorganisms may evoke an inflammatory response, therefore supporting the potential anti-inflammatory role of AHCC in IBD. AHCC may also limit inflammation of the colon by enhancing mucosal barrier function.Mascaraque 2014\n\nLiver dysfunction or injury/hepatoprotection\nExcess nitric oxide production may be involved with liver injury. AHCC may decrease inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by reducing mRNA stabilization, rather than by inhibiting its synthesis.Matsui 2007, Matsui 2008\n\nIn vitro data\nIn primary cultured hepatocytes, simultaneous administration of AHCC-sugar fraction (AHCC-sf) 1 to 8 mg/mL with IL-1beta decreased nitric oxide production. Levels of iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA were also decreased, which suggests AHCC-sf inhibits the induction of iNOS gene expression at a transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional step in proinflammatory cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes. These results suggest AHCC has liver-protectant effects.Matsui 2011\n\nClinical data\nIn patients with liver injury due to excessive alcohol ingestion, AHCC supplementation at dosages of 1 g/day (three 167 mg capsules 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner) and 3 g/day (three 500 mg capsules 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner) for 12 weeks improved ALT levels, decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and elevated adiponectin without any adverse effects. The improvement in liver enzyme levels, decrease in proinflammatory cytokines, and elevation of anti-inflammatory cytokines indicate that AHCC is beneficial in liver injury. No adverse events occurred in either group.Kim 2014\nIn another study, patients with chronic hepatitis C received AHCC 2 g 3 times daily for 24 weeks, which demonstrated reductions in HCV RNA levels in genotype-3 patients and control of ALT levels in all patients.Thaiudom 2010"}
{"prompt": "What interactions does AHCC have?", "completion": "CYP induction metabolism assays indicate that AHCC induces CYP2D6 by a similar mechanism as doxorubicin; however, one study did not demonstrate interference of AHCC with tamoxifen activity in mice but did show a decrease in letrozole activity when given in combination with AHCC.Mathew 2017 Data suggest that AHCC is safe to administer with most other chemotherapy agents not metabolized by CYP2D6.Ito 2014 Data also show that AHCC potentially induces aromatase enzyme activity when given alone.Mathew 2017 Concomitant use with aromatase inhibitors is not recommended until further studies have been conducted."}

Ahzantive blocks VEGF, reducing VEGF levels and helping to slow the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This stops fluid leakage, reduces swelling, and prevents further vision loss. In some people, Ahzantive may improve vision. Ahzantive belongs to the drug class called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors.\nAhzantive was approved on June 28, 2024, as a biosimilar to Eylea (aflibercept). A biosimilar is a biological product that is like the reference biologic (in this case Eylea) and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency."}

No formal drug interaction trials have been performed with AirDuo Digihaler.\n7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4\n\nFluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the individual components of AirDuo Digihaler, are substrates of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with AirDuo Digihaler is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid and increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.\n\nRitonavir: Fluticasone Propionate: A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal suppression.\n\nKetoconazole: Fluticasone Propionate: Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9\u2011fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC) but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.\n\nSalmeterol: In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16\u2011fold and Cmax increased 1.4\u2011fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta2\u2011agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants\n\nAirDuo Digihaler should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.\n7.3 Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents\n\nBeta\u2011blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta\u2011agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta\u2011blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta\u2011adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta\u2011blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.\n7.4 Non-Potassium-Sparing Diuretics\n\nThe ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non\u2013potassium\u2011sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta\u2011agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of AirDuo Digihaler, especially when the recommended dose of the beta\u2011agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of AirDuo Digihaler with non\u2013potassium\u2011sparing diuretics."}
{"prompt": "What are the uses of AirDuo Digihaler with eModule?", "completion": "Fluticasone and salmeterol is a combination of two medicines that are used to help control the symptoms of asthma and improve breathing. It is used when a patient's asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient's condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day. This medicine will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.\nThis medicine is also used to treat air flow blockage and reduce the worsening of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.\nInhaled fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids (cortisone-like medicines). It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms.\nInhaled salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. It relieves cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.\nThis medicine must be used with a short-acting medicine (eg, albuterol) for an asthma attack or asthma symptoms that need attention right away.\nThis medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription."}

Of these, 1730 patients were exposed to AJOVY 225 mg monthly or AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for at least 6 months, 775 patients for at least 12 months, and 138 patients for at least 15 months. In placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2), 662 patients received AJOVY 225 mg monthly for 12 weeks (with or without a loading dose of 675 mg), and 663 patients received AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In the controlled trials, 87% of patients were female, 80% were White, and the mean age was 41 years.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine (incidence at least 5% and greater than placebo) were injection site reactions. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuations were injection site reactions (1%).

Of these patients, 209 received AJOVY monthly for at least 6 months and 100 received AJOVY for at least 12 months. In the placebo-controlled trial (Study 3), 123 pediatric patients with episodic migraine were treated with AJOVY [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In the three Phase 3 clinical trials, 1673 subjects with acne vulgaris on the face and trunk, 9 years and older were exposed to AKLIEF Cream. Of these, 1220 subjects were treated once daily for up to 12 weeks and 453 were treated once daily for up to 1 year.\n\nAdverse reactions reported in the 2 randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled 12-week clinical trials in \u22651.0% of subjects treated with AKLIEF Cream (and for which the rate exceeded the rate for vehicle), as well as the corresponding rates reported in subjects treated with the vehicle cream are presented in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1.

A total of 12.6% of subjects had at least one adverse reaction during the trial, and 2.9% of subjects had an adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions (\u22651% of subjects) for the entire trial were application site pruritus (4.6%), application site irritation (4.2%), and sunburn (5.5%). The frequency of adverse reactions decreased over time.\n\nSkin irritation was evaluated by active assessment of erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning and collected separately. In the two 12-week Phase 3 clinical trials, these signs/symptoms were assessed at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit, in 1214 subjects (for face) and 1202 subjects (for trunk) treated with AKLIEF Cream. The percentage of subjects who were assessed to have these signs and symptoms at any post baseline visit and at a severity worse than baseline are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of Albuked?", "completion": "Emergency Treatment of Hypovolemic Shock\nAlbuked 25 is hyperoncotic and on intravenous infusion will expand the plasma volume by an additional amount, three to four times the volume actually administered, by withdrawing fluid from the interstitial spaces, provided the patient is normally hydrated interstitially or there is interstitial edema.(1) If the patient is dehydrated, additional crystalloids must be given,(4) or alternatively, Albumin (Human) 5%, USP (Albuked\u2122 5) should be used. The patient\u2019s hemodynamic response should be monitored and the usual precautions against circulatory overload observed. The total dose should not exceed the level of albumin found in the normal individual, i.e., about 2 g per kg body weight in the absence of active bleeding. Although Albuked 5 is to be preferred for the usual volume deficits, Albuked 25 with appropriate crystalloids may offer therapeutic advantages in oncotic deficits or in long-standing shock where treatment has been delayed.(2)\nRemoval of ascitic fluid from a patient with cirrhosis may cause changes in cardiovascular function and even result in hypovolemic shock. In such circumstances, the use of an albumin infusion may be required to support the blood volume.(2)\nBurn Therapy\nAn optimal therapeutic regimen with respect to the administration of colloids, crystalloids, and water following extensive burns has not been established. During the first 24 hours after sustaining thermal injury, large volumes of crystalloids are infused to restore the depleted extracellular fluid volume. Beyond 24 hours Albuked 25 can be used to maintain plasma colloid osmotic pressure.\nHypoproteinemia With or Without Edema\nDuring major surgery, patients can lose over half of their circulating albumin with the attendant complications of oncotic deficit.(2,4,5) A similar situation can occur in sepsis or intensive care patients. Treatment with Albuked 25 may be of value in such cases.(2)\nAdult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)(2,5)\nThis is characterized by deficient oxygenation caused by pulmonary interstitial edema complicating shock and postsurgical conditions. When clinical signs are those of hypoproteinemia with a fluid volume overload, Albuked 25 together with a diuretic may play a role in therapy.\nCardiopulmonary Bypass(2,6)\nWith the relatively small priming volume required with modern pumps, preoperative dilution of the blood using albumin and crystalloid has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. Although the limit to which the hematocrit and plasma protein concentration can be safely lowered has not been defined, it is common practice to adjust the albumin and crystalloid pump prime to achieve a hematocrit of 20% and a plasma albumin concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL in the patient.\nAcute Liver Failure (2)\nIn the uncommon situation of rapid loss of liver function with or without coma, administration of albumin may serve the double purpose of supporting the colloid osmotic pressure of the plasma as well as binding excess plasma bilirubin.\nNeonatal Hemolytic Disease(2,3)\nThe administration of Albuked 25 may be indicated prior to exchange transfusion, in order to bind free bilirubin, thus lessening the risk of kernicterus. A dosage of 1 g /kg body weight is given about 1 hour prior to exchange transfusion. Caution must be observed in hypervolemic infants.\nSequestration of Protein Rich Fluids(7)\nThis occurs in such conditions as acute peritonitis, pancreatitis, mediastinitis, and extensive cellulitis. The magnitude of loss into the third space may require treatment of reduced volume or oncotic activity with an infusion of albumin.\nErythrocyte Resuspension(2)\nAlbumin may be required to avoid excessive hypoproteinemia, during certain types of exchange transfusion, or with the use of very large volumes of previously frozen or washed red cells. About 25 g of albumin per liter of erythrocytes is commonly used, although the requirements in preexistent hypoproteinemia or hepatic impairment can be greater. Albuked 25 is added to the isotonic suspension of washed red cells immediately prior to transfusion.\nAcute Nephrosis(2)\nCertain patients may not respond to cyclophosphamide or steroid therapy. The steroids may even aggravate the underlying edema. In this situation a loop diuretic and 100 mL Albuked 25 repeated daily for 7 to 10 days may be helpful in controlling the edema and the patient may then respond to steroid treatment.\nRenal Dialysis(2)\nAlthough not part of the regular regimen of renal dialysis, Albuked 25 may be of value in the treatment of shock or hypotension in these patients. The usual volume administered is about 100 mL, taking particular care to avoid fluid overload as these patients are often fluid overloaded and cannot tolerate substantial volumes of salt solution.\nSituations in Which Albumin Administration is Not Warranted(2)\nIn chronic nephrosis, infused albumin is promptly excreted by the kidneys with no relief of the chronic edema or effect on the underlying renal lesion. It is of occasional use in the rapid \u201cpriming\u201d diuresis of nephrosis. Similarly, in hypoproteinemic states associated with chronic cirrhosis, malabsorption, protein losing enteropathies, pancreatic insufficiency, and undernutrition, the infusion of albumin as a source of protein nutrition is not justified."}

The table lists the incidence of all adverse events (whether considered by the investigator drug related or unrelated to drug) from this study which occurred at a rate of 3% or greater in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol treatment group and more frequently in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol treatment group than in the matched placebo group. Overall, the incidence and nature of the adverse events reported for albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol and the marketed active comparator HFA-134a albuterol inhaler were comparable.\n\nAdverse Experience Incidences (% of Patients) in a Six-Week Clinical Trial *\n*\nThis table includes all adverse events (whether considered by the investigator drug related or unrelated to drug) which occurred at an incidence rate of at least 3.0% in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol group and more frequently in the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol group than in the placebo HFA Inhalation Aerosol group.\n\nBody System/ Adverse Event (as Preferred Term)\n\t\n\tAlbuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol\n(N = 58)\n\tMarketed active comparator HFA-134a\nalbuterol inhaler\n(N = 56)\n\tMatched Placebo HFA-134a\nInhalation Aerosol\n(N = 58)\n\nBody as a Whole\n\tHeadache\n\t7\n\t5\n\t2\n\nCardiovascular\n\tTachycardia\n\t3\n\t2\n\t0\n\nMusculoskeletal\n\tPain\n\t3\n\t0\n\t0\n\nNervous System\n\tDizziness\n\t3\n\t0\n\t0\n\nRespiratory System\n\tPharyngitis Rhinitis\n\t14\n5\n\t7\n4\n\t9\n2\n\n\nAdverse events reported by less than 3% of the patients receiving albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol but by a greater proportion of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol patients than the matched placebo patients, which have the potential to be related to albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, included chest pain, infection, diarrhea, glossitis, accidental injury (nervous system), anxiety, dyspnea, ear disorder, ear pain, and urinary tract infection.\n\nIn small cumulative dose studies, tremor, nervousness, and headache were the most frequently occurring adverse events.\n\nPediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age\n\nAdverse events reported in a 3-week pediatric clinical trial comparing the same formulation of albuterol as in albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol (180 mcg albuterol four times daily) to a matching placebo HFA inhalation aerosol occurred at a low incidence rate (no greater than 2% in the active treatment group) and were similar to those seen in adult and adolescent trials.\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience\n\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reports have included rare cases of aggravated bronchospasm, lack of efficacy, asthma exacerbation (reported fatal in one case), muscle cramps, and various oropharyngeal side-effects such as throat irritation, altered taste, glossitis, tongue ulceration, and gagging.\n\nThe following adverse events have been observed in postapproval use of inhaled albuterol: urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hoarseness, oropharyngeal edema, and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles). In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as: angina, hypertension or hypotension, palpitations, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia, headache, nervousness, tremor, muscle cramps, drying or irritation of the oropharynx, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis."}
{"prompt": "What interactions does Albuterol Aerosol have?", "completion": "Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.\n7.1 Beta-Blockers\n\nBeta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, consider cardioselective beta-blockers, although they should be administered with caution.\n7.2 Diuretics\n\nThe ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non- potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.\n7.3 Digoxin\n\nMean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol.\n7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants\n\nAlbuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants."}

Ethyl Alcohol, or ethanol (C2H5OH), is the type used in the production of alcoholic beverages. The other three types, methyl, propyl and butyl alcohol, if consumed can result in blindness and death, even in relatively small doses.\nAlcohol, or ethanol, is the intoxicating agent found in beer, wine and liquor. Alcohol is produced by fermentation of yeast, sugars, and starches.1 Fruits such as grapes, and grains like barley and wheat are most commonly used for wine, beer and liquors. Other plants, such as the cactus or sugar cane may be used in liquor production.\nFourteen grams or about 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol equals one \u201cdrink\u201d. Examples of this amount may include one twelve ounce beer (5 percent alcohol), eight to nine ounces of malt liquor (7 percent alcohol), 5 ounces of wine (12 percent alcohol) or 1.5 fluid ounce \u201cshot\u201d of 80 proof liquor (40 percent alcohol).\nIn the U.S., The Federal Uniform Drinking Age Act, signed into law in 1984 raised the minimum drinking age to 21 years. All states now prohibit the purchase of alcohol by youth under the age of 21 years since 1988. It is illegal to sell or buy alcohol for anyone under the age of 21. According to The Office of the Surgeon General, alcohol is used by more young people in the United States than tobacco or illicit drugs, resulting in a serious public health concern.2"}
